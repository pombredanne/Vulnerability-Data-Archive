The NetSupport Manager Gateway now has two additional configuration options available on the Security Tab of the Gateway configuration utility these are detailed below Enable encryption of communications to remote computers\nThis option is checked by default and enables the encryption of all Header information when communicating with Clients or Controls that are version 11.00.0005 or later. Clients and Controls from previous versions will still be able to communicate however, communications with older versions will contain unencrypted data in the header.
