  "Description": "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions  - CVE-2017-3210\nA number of applications developed using the Portrait Displays SDK do not use secure permissions when running. These applications run the component pdiservice.exe with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM permissions. This component is also read/writable by all Authenticated Users. This allows local authenticated attackers to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The following applications have been identified by Portrait Displays as affected: Fujitsu DisplayView Click: Version 6.0 and 6.01\nThe issue was fixed in Version 6.3 Fujitsu DisplayView Click Suite: Version 5\nThe issue is addressed by patch in Version 5.9 HP Display Assistant: Version 2.1\nThe issue was fixed in Version 2.11 HP My Display: Version 2.0\nThe issue was fixed in Version 2.1 Philips Smart Control Premium: Versions 2.23, 2.25\nThe issue was fixed in Version 2.26",
