  "Description": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. One such padding scheme is specified in the Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 (PKCS-1), which is defined in RFC 3447. The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library incorrectly parses PKCS-1 padded signatures due to the use of a vulnerable implementation of ASN.1 encoding of DigestInfo. This vulnerable implementation parses as BER rather than DER encoded, allowing field lengths to be flexibly interpreted and enabling an attacker to both bypass the mitigation for the original Bleichenbacher vulnerability and ignore data within the signature. If this data is ignored and a RSA key with a public exponent of three is used, it may be possible to forge the signing key's signature. It is possible that other cryptographic libraries may be similarly affected. This package is often included in many other 3rd party software, including Linux distributions, Google Chrome, and others.",
