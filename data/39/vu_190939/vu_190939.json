  "Workarounds": "From the HP Support Document: The vulnerabilities can also be resolved by the following procedure: Set the kill bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control's Class identifier (CLSID) {14C1B87C-3342-445F-9B5E-365FF330A3AC} . The kill bit is set by modifying the data value of the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the CLSID of this ActiveX control to 0x00000400.
