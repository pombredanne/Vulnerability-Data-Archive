  "Description": "Bradford Network Sentry v5.3 NS500 appliance contains multiple vulnerabilities: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), CVE-2012-2604\n(1) The Guest/Contractor access page on the administrative interface, http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/GuestAccess.jsp, is vulnerable to a persistent XSS vulnerability. A lower level user can inject a persistent XSS payload into the affected fields. This could affect a higher level administrator when they view this page enabling the lower level admin to potentially escalate privileges to a higher level admin. There could also be other pages on the interface that are susceptible to XSS as well. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), CVE-2012-2605\n(2) All pages are vulnerable to CSRF on the administrative interface. A lower level admin could use the previous XSS vulnerability in conjunction with the CSRF to escalate privileges. All other pages are vulnerable as well. Another example is to send a message to all clients that have the agent installed to persuade them to visit a malicious link. CWE-287: Improper Authentication, CVE-2012-2606\n(3) The Bradford agent that is installed on a client workstation listens on UDP port 4567. The agent normally would receive data from the server and one action is to display a message on the user's screen. There is no authentication or verification on the authenticity of the message. A malicious user could send a specially crafted packet to this port and display a message to the user to visit a malicious website to compromise the client. Other actions could possibly be performed as well.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a Bradford Network Sentry v5.3 NS500 appliance using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
