  "Description": "> I have found that a number of irix6.2 programs suffer from the same type\n> of buffer overflow as reported on bugtraq a couple of months ago and in your\n> recent advisory, CA-97.21 of July 16, 1997. They are\n\n/usr/bin/X11/xconsole\n/usr/lib/addnetpr\n/usr/sbin/monpanel\n/usr/sbin/xwsh\n/usr/sbin/scanners\n/usr/Cadmin/bin/configClogin\n/usr/Cadmin/bin/chaltsys\n\n\n\n- I enclose an official inquiry which I have sent to SGI this afternoon.\nI have also spoken to Miguel Sanches (Customer Service) who indicated that\nthey (SGI) are aware of an overflow bug in these binaries and are actively\nworking on appropriate patches.\n\n- Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n[  Thanks - please convey to SGI.  I will forward your note to them as well.\n[  It helps when the vendor hears directly from the customer.\n[\n[  If you can send us the exploit scripts, that would be helpful.  Please send\n[  them to the vendor too!\n...\n[  Miguel,\n[\n[  - I enclose my original report which I have sent to CERT list Friday.  Ihave\nused an exploit written by David Hedley (hedley@cs.bris.ac.uk) and slightly\nmodified by Patrick J..Paulus (pjp@stepahead.net), published in a posting to\nbugtraq on May 27, 97.:",
