  "Overview": "The Verizon Wireless web site allows users to move from one page to another on their site without having to reauthenticate each time by using session IDs. Prior to <date>, session IDs were created in a particular predictable way, allowing an intruder to bypass the authentication mechanism and masquerade as another user of the system.",
