  "Workarounds": "Disable the HTTP server Because this problem exists in the handling of HTTP requests, disabling the HTTP server prevents the vulnerability from being exploited. Information about disabling the HTTP server is provided in the Cisco security advisory on this topic. Enable TACACS+ or Radius Authentication This vulnerability is not present when the Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+) or Radius authentication systems are used. Enabling one of these authentication mechanisms in place of local authorization databases will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. Information about enabling TACACS+ or Radius can be found in the following Cisco document: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/480/tacplus.shtml"
