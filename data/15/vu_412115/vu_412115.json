  "ID": "VU#412115",
  "IDNumber": "412115",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to harvest potentially sensitive information from network traffic. In some network environments, this vulnerability can also be used to circumvent technologies that divide networks into separate domains, such as VLANs and routers.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Ethernet",
    "network device driver",
    "arbitrary user",
    "network traffic",
    "information leakage",
    "pad",
    "frame buffer"
  ],
  "Overview": "Many network device drivers reuse old frame buffer data to pad packets, resulting in an information leakage vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to harvest sensitive information from affected devices.",

  "VRDA_D1_Impact": "2",
  "VRDA_D1_Population": "4",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Use encryption to protect sensitive data By using encryption to protect network traffic, vulnerable sites can greatly reduce the impact of this vulnerability. Affected device drivers will still leak information, but fragments of encrypted information will be useless to attackers. Note that this workaround will not protect sensitive information leaked from non-network sources such as kernel memory."
