  "Description": "PRIMOS allows one to protect EPF files (executables)\nfor execute only access; however, a problem exists when a new copy\nof the program is created.  The EPFs are mapped to read and\nexecute segments--the program reads the segment and writes out a\nnew copy of the EPF wherever the user chooses and has access.\n\nIf EPF doesn't occupy a whole page, other data from previous\ncommands/text may be copied from the segment and appended to\nnew object code.",
  "ID": "VU#10915",
  "IDNumber": "10915",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Because unwanted information may be appended to file, comparing\nold vs new executables will be different. The appended material\ncould contain sensitive information.",
