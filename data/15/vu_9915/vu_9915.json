  "References": "There is a problem with 5.1.  It is fixed in the product that is\ncurrently shipping.  Customers with a 5.1 that has the problem\ncan request a free copy of the current release.\n5.0 and earlier customers can (at cost) upgrade to 5.1 or install\nthe workaround (below).\n\nYou can tell if your 5.1 version is vulnerable by looking at the\nrelease date in HELP.  If it is 4/29/93 or later, then the problem\nis fixed.  If the release date is earlier, then you have the problem.\n\nThis problem also exists in Office 3.1.  The wrapper will work for it.",

  "Workarounds": "In WP 6.0 the lpr mechanism is completely\nredesigned and none of their code is setuid any longer. A workaround is to put a \"wrapper\" around wpexc so that\nit no longer need be setuid. The wrapper cleanses the environment\nbefore execing the original wpexc binary. Simply removing the setuid bit from wpexc solves the security\nproblem but according to WP, does so at the expense of a high\nprobability of getting a variety of errors. They did not get\nspecific, but their database reported a number of problem reports\nby users who had accidentally unset the setuid bit that went\naway when the setuid bit was turned back on. They claim to not\nhave the resources to thoroughly track down all the impacts\nof removing the setuid and do not recommend it to customers."
