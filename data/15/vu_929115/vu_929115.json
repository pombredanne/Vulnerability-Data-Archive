  "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. An attacker may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due to the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash PHP and/or the web server running on an x86 architecture.",
  "Keywords": [
    "PHP",
    "HTTP POST request",
    "headers"
  ],
  "Overview": "A vulnerability has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP and/or the web server.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Please contact your vendor directly. Upgrade to the latest version of PHP If a patch is not available from your vendor, upgrade to version 4.2.2. Deny POST requests\nUntil patches or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST requests. The following workaround is taken from the PHP Security Advisory: If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests on the web server. In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level .htaccess file: <Limit POST> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Order deny,allow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deny from all\n</Limit> \nNote that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above. Disable vulnerable service\nUntil you can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully consider your service requirements.",
