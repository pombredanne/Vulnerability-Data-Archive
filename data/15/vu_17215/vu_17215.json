  "Description": " On some SGI systems, Netscape is bundled with IRIX 6.3 and 6.4and is used as the default web browser and mail reader. On these systems, the mailcap file has been extended to include the line\n\n          application/x-sgi-exec; /usr/sysadm/bin/runexec %s; \\\n           description=\"System Administration Executable\"\n\nThe mailcap file is an association between content-type specifications and programs or commands to interpret those types. The system mailcap file usually resides in /etc/mailcap, /usr/etc/mailcap, or /usr/local/etc/mailcap; however, the location of the mailcap file is configurable by system administrators. Additionally, individuals can have their own mailcap file in $HOME/.mailcap. The entries in users' personal mailcap file will override the entries in the system mailcap file on an entry-by-entry basis. That is, the effective mapping of content-types to programs is the combination of the system mailcap file and the user's own mailcap file. In the case of a conflict, the user's own mailcap file has precedence.\n\nAlthough this description necessarily mentions Netscape Communicator, we wish to make it clear that the vulnerability does not lie with Communicator.\n\nAny program that obeys the mailcap file, including metamail and\nprograms that use metamail to provide MIME functionality, can be used to exploit this vulnerability. Netscape is mentioned because vulnerable systems\nship with Netscape installed as the default mail reader and web browser.\n",

  "Impact": "Intruders may be able to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems by inducing a victim to read appropriately crafted email messages and web pages. If privileged users use a vulnerable mail system to read a mail, an intruder may be able to gain root access.",
