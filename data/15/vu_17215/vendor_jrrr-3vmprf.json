Security Advisory Title:   IRIX 6.3 & 6.4 mailcap vulnerability\n        Number:  19980403-01-PX\n        Date:    April 2, 1998 Silicon Graphics provides this information freely to the SGI user community\nfor its consideration, interpretation, implementation and use. Silicon\nGraphics recommends that this information be acted upon as soon as possible. Silicon Graphics provides the information in this Security Advisory on\nan \"AS-IS\" basis only, and disclaims all warranties with respect thereto,\nexpress, implied or otherwise, including, without limitation, any warranty\nof merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall\nSilicon Graphics be liable for any loss of profits, loss of business, loss\nof data or for any indirect, special, exemplary, incidental or consequential\ndamages of any kind arising from your use of, failure to use or improper\nuse of any of the instructions or information in this Security Advisory. - - --- Issue Specifics --- The System Manager sysmgr(1M) provides a web-browser-like GUI interface to\ntasks that help you administer an SGI workstation. sysmgr(1M) uses multiple\ntools to manage its GUI interface, two of them being runtask(1M) and\nrunexec(1M). By mimicking the descriptor files of runtask(1M) or runexec(1M), an SGI user\nbrowsing web pages or reading email can inadvertently download a\n\"trojan horse\" runtask(1M) or runexec(1M) descriptor file. The \"trojan horse\"\ndescriptor file will execute a local System Manager Task with the privileges\nof the user web browsing and can lead to a local root compromise. Silicon Graphics Inc. has investigated the issue and recommends the\nfollowing steps for neutralizing the exposure. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nthat these measures be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems. This\nissue will be corrected in future releases of IRIX. - - --- Impact --- All IRIX 6.3/6.4 users that have Mailcap entries for x-sgi-task\nand x-sgi-exec have this vulnerability. On IRIX 6.3/6.4, these vulnerable\nMailcap entries are installed by default in /usr/local/lib/netscape/mailcap . Users can add their own Mailcap entries in their home directories\n($HOME/.mailcap) and these need to be inspected for the vulnerable x-sgi-task\nand x-sgi-exec entries. By default, this vulnerability requires an IRIX 6.3/6.4 user to use\nNetscape Navigator to web browse or read email from a malicious site\nand download a \"trojan horse\" System Manager Task which will execute\nlocally with the privileges of the user web browsing. If the user is a\nprivileged or root user, the \"trojan horse\" System Manger Task will execute\nwith root privileges and can lead to a root compromise. - - --- Temporary Solution --- Although patches are available for this issue, it is realized that\nthere may be situations where installing the patches immediately may\nnot be possible. 1) Become the root user on the system. % /bin/su -\n                Password: 2) Edit the default Mailcap file. # vi /usr/local/lib/netscape/mailcap 3) Remove the following vulnerable mailcap entries: application/x-sgi-task; /usr/sysadm/bin/runtask %s; description=\"System Administration Task\" application/x-sgi-exec; /usr/sysadm/bin/runexec %s; description=\"System Administration Executable\" 4) Find any additional mailcap files and remove any vulnerable entries. You will need to run the find(1) command on each system you\n        maintain because the command examines files on local disks only. Note that this is one long command, though we have separated it\n        onto three lines using backslashes. # find / -local -type f  -name 'mailcap'  -o \\\n                   -name '.mailcap' -exec egrep 'runexec|runtask' {} \\\n                   /dev/null \\; This command will find all files on a system that: are only in the local file system (/ -local)\n            are regular files (-type f)\n            have the name \"mailcap\" (-name 'mailcap') or the name \".mailcap\" Once found, those files will be searched for the string \"runexec\" or\n        \"runtask\" (-exec egrep 'runexec|runtask' {}) and have their path names\n        printed . The addition of /dev/null as an argument causes grep to list the\n        full pathname of any file containing the string, rather than just the\n        basename. Edit the files that have the pathnames printed and remove any\n        vulnerable runtask/runexec mailcap entries. 5) Return to previous level. # exit - - --- Solution --- OS Version     Vulnerable?
