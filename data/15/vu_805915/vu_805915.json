  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict Access Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application layer firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to Apache. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Disable Vulnerable Service Disable the vulnerable service (modplsql or mod_plsql in Apache)."
