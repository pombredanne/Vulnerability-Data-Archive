  "Description": "The \"no ip source-routing\" command in the Cisco routers\nis supposed to cause source routed packets to be rejected, but doesn't.",
  "ID": "VU#19973",
  "IDNumber": "19973",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If packets are allowed to any host behind the Cisco that also\nallow source routed packets (SunOS <= 4.1.2 does, for example),\nthen you can use source routing to get to any machine on the local net\neven when the cisco is configured for no source routing. Thus, if (anonymous) FTP is allowed to a machine behind the firewall,\nbut the Cisco is configured to deny FTP access to other machines,\nit is still possible to send source-routed FTP packets to the\nFTP server which then forwards the packets on to another machine\nbehind the firewall. The intended denial of FTP access to the other\nmachines has been circumvented.",
