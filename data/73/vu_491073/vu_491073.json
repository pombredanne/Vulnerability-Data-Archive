  "Workarounds": "Disable access to the Microsoft Access Wizard Controls in Internet Explorer Access to the ImexGrid ActiveX control in Internet Explorer can be disabled by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {53230322-172B-11D0-AD40-00A0C90DC8D9} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites."
