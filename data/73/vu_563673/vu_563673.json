  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds may partially mitigate this vulnerability: Check log files for stored AAA credentials, and change passwords if needed. Use management VLANs to seperate syslog network traffic from other devices on the network. Use access controls, file permissions, and physical security to ensure that syslog files can not be read by unauthorized individuals."
