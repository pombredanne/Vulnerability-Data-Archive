  "Workarounds": "Restrict access to the server Until a fixed version of the server can be deployed, consider restricting remote access to the server to only trusted hosts. You can restrict the access by using firewalls or by only connecting the server to private networks that are not connected to systems with Internet access. Critical systems (such as industrial control systems) should either not be connected to corporate networks with Internet connectivity or should be connected in a controlled way. If connecting the control system network to the corporate network is necessary, a firewall should be deployed to monitor and control traffic flow between the two networks."
