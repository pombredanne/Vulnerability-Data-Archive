  "Workarounds": "Mitigation Monitor and/or restrict access to the Concurrent Manager server(s). It may be possible to use TCP Wrappers or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. For more information about which ports to filter, please see the Integrity Security Alert."
