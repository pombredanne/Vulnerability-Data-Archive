  "Description": "lpr(1) can be used to overwrite or create (and become owner of)\nany file on the system.  lpr -s allows users to create symbolic\nlinks in lpd's spool directory (typically /var/spool/lpd).\nAfter 1000 invocations of lpr, lpr will reuse the filename in\nthe spool directory, and follow the link previously installed.\nIt will thus overwrite/create any file that this link points too.",

  "Impact": "Any user with access to lpr(1) can alter system files and thus\nbecome root.",

  "Workarounds": "If you do not have source, you are advised to obtain the BSD\nLP subsystem from the NET/2 release (available from ftp.uu.net),\napply the above patch, and use that. Alternatively, some vendors supply both the BSD and SYS V\nLP subsystems, in which case you can disable BSD lpr/lpd\nand use SYS V lp/lpsched instead. If none of the above are practical, you are advised to restrict\naccess (via groups) to lpr. If lpr is mode 6755 on your system,\nyou can still do this using a directory and a symbolic link."
