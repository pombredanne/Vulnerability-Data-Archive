  "IDNumber": "426273",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "On systems where the sticky bit is not set on the /tmp directory, a local attacker can gain ownership of any file on the system. This allows the attacker to gain root privileges. This attack may also be possible on systems where the /tmp directory does have its sticky bit set, depending on the exact sequence of calls used to create and set the ownership of the Kerberos ticket file.",
  "Keywords": [
    "login",
    "su"
  ],
  "Overview": "There may be a race condition during the creation of Kerberos ticket files in the /tmp directory. This race condition may allow intruders with local access to the system to gain root privileges.",
