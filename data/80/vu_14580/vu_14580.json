  "Description": "There is a set of machines at Berkeley that was able to connect\nto any machine on our network, in spite of the access control\nlists on our cisco router, if and only if we had an entry in\nthose ACL's that contained the ``established'' keyword.  The\nestablished keyword is supposed to match any packet that has\neither the ACK or RST bits set in the TCP header.  All TCP\npackets have one or (rarely) both of these bits set, except for\nthe first SYN packet that is sent at the beginning of a\nconnection.  Thus, the established keyword matches any packet\nthat is part of an established connection.  The ACL configuration\nwe wanted to use started with an entry that allowed any such\npackets.  Since the start-of-connection packets would not match\nthis entry, the rest of the ACL entries would be used to control\nwhich connections were allowed to be established.  After that,\nall subsequent packets would match the first ACL entry and be\nallowed by the cisco very quickly.  With this configuration the\ninitial SYN packets sent from those machines at Berkeley were\nalso being allowed through.  When we changed the ACL to enforce\nour policies without the use of the established keyword, the\nconnections from those machines were correctly denied.",

  "Impact": "If a Cisco router is configured to use extended IP access lists for\ntraffic filtering on an MCI, SCI, cBus or cBusII interface, and the IP\nroute cache is enabled, and the \"established\" keyword is used in the\naccess list, then the access list can be improperly evaluated. This\ncan permit packets which should be filtered and filter packets which\nshould be permitted.",

  "Workarounds": "This vulnerability can be avoided by either rewriting the extended\naccess list to not use the \"established\" keyword, or by configuring\nthe interface to not use the IP route cache. To disable the IP route\ncache, use the configuration command \"no ip route-cache\"."
