  "Description": "Clear Skies Security's advisory states: \"Enduser Authentication Bypass\nUser-level access to the Proofpoint mail filter web interface can be obtained as any available user without providing the user\u2019s login credentials. Path Traversal Allows Access to System Files\nArbitrary files on the Proofpoint appliance can be obtained by manipulating a flaw in the web interface. Proofpoint SQL Injection\nA publicly accessible function in the Proofpoint interface is vulnerable to SQL Injection. Proofpoint Command Injection\nA function in the Proofpoint web interface can be manipulated into executing any command on the server. Proofpoint Forced Browsing / Insufficient Page Authorization\nSome administrative modules are accessible without authenticating with the application.\"",
