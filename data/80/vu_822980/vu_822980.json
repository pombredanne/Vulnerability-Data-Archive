  "Description": "According to the researcher, the SysLINK SL-1000 M2M Modular Gateway contains multiple vulnerabilities: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2016-2331 By default, the device's web interface uses a default password across all devices and does not prompt the administrator to change that password. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CVE-2016-2332 The device's web interface runs as the root user and is vulnerable to command injection via an authenticated POST request to flu.cgi. The parameter \"5066\" (dnsmasq) is vulnerable to injection. Commands are constructed and run as the root user. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2016-2333 The device uses an encryption key that is hard-coded and believed to be static across the entire device population. The CERT/CC has been unable to confirm these vulnerabilities with the vendor. It is also unclear if models other than the SL-1000 are affected.",
