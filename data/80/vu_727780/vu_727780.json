  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to gain unintended access to the private network on the affected device. Attackers could leverage this access to exploit additional, unrelated vulnerabilities in services that use the same TCP port as that used to tunnel the IPsec traffic.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Cisco recommends adding rules to the filter for the private interface that restrict outgoing traffic on ports configured for use by IPsec over TCP on the VPN concentrator. This would not stop the traffic from the public network reaching the VPN 3000 concentrator itself but would prevent the traffic from reaching the servers on the private network. If patches cannot be applied, sites may wish to select a less-commonly used TCP port for the IPsec tunnel to limit the services that might be available to attack over the tunnel."
