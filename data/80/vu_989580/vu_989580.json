  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could read the script source code contained in files with insecure permissions. Script source code may contain sensitive information such as database credentials.",

  "Overview": "Hummingbird CyberDOCS running on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) sets insecure permissions on script source code files. A remote attacker could read the contents of unprotected files.",
  "References": "http://www.procheckup.com/security_info/vuln_pr0302.html",
  "Resolution": "Modify IIS file permissions\nAccording to Hummingbird: Start Internet Services Manager (IIS). Expand Default Web Site and select CyberDOCS. In the right-hand pane, select an unprotected file with the \".INC\" extension. Right-click and select Properties. On the File tab, clear the check mark from the \"Script source access,\" \"Read,\" and \"Write\" options. Click OK to save the changes. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all remaining unprotected \"*.INC,\" \"*.ASA,\" \"*.LIC,\" \"*.LOG,\" \"*.Settings,\" and \"*.BAK\" files that should be protected. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for other sub-directories that also contain the above unprotected files. NOTE: This process will cause IIS to restart CyberDOCS resulting in all user sessions to be lost.",
