  "Description": "According to ICSA-11-056-01: A vulnerability in TCPUploadServer.exe allows a remote, unauthenticated host to execute functions on the server. Exploiting this vulnerability will allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files, execute a program with an arbitrary argument, crash the server, obtain information about specific aspects of the remote host, and more. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the server on Port 10651/TCP that can cause the system to respond with OS version and drive information. In addition, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet that causes the system to delete a file or that crashes the server.",

  "Resolution": "According to ICSA-11-056-01: Progea has developed and released an update to address this vulnerability: http://support.progea.com/download/Mov11.2_Setup.zip. ICS-CERT recommends that Movicon users implement the following additional mitigation steps: 1. Implement firewall rules to limit network access to the Movicon system on Port 10651/TCP. 2. Update Movicon to the latest Version 11.2. 3. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet. Control system networks and remote devices should be located behind firewalls and isolated from the business network. If remote access is required, employ secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).",
