  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If /etc/default is changed to be world-writable, an attacker may be able to create a symbolic link with predictable name, and point it to any writable file on the system. This may cause corruption of the file.",

  ],
  "Overview": "Shadow-utils is an encryption and account management package freely distributed for many Linux implementations. The useradd program in this package creates insecure temporary files with predictable names in a write-protected directory. If this directory is changed to be writable, an attacker may be able to use a symbolic link attack to overwrite arbitrary files.",
