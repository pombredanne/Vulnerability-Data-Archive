  "Description": "The ftp proxy part of mod_proxy accepts directory listings\nfrom remote ftp servers and converts them to HTML to send\nto the client.  It is possible to deliberately create a\nlisting that will cause Apache to dump core.\n\nThis hole does not compromise the server; the only risk\nis that it would be possible to use this to create a\ndenial of service attack which would render the server\neffectively inoperative.\n\nIf you do not use mod_proxy, you are not vulnerable to this.\nIf you restrict the use of mod_proxy, then only those users\nwho are permitted to use it can attempt to exploit this\nproblem.",
