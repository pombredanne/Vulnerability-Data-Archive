  "Description": "CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow\nBulletProof FTP Client 2010 does not check the length of the host parameter set in the quick connect bar. A long host value causes a stack-based buffer overflow, possibly allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
  "ID": "VU#565580",
  "IDNumber": "565580",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A local attacker may be able to overwrite the stack memory causing the process to crash or create unpredictable behavior. It is possible that this vulnerability may be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged in user.",

  "Workarounds": "Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0 on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will."
