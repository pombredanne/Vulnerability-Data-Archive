  "Description": "We've had the following vulnerability report from Alan Cox\n<alan@cymru.net>: 1.  Sending most BSD systems a valid IP datagram\nprotocol UDP but with no UDP header or payload causes a kernel\npanic. You can easily deliver these datagrams unicast or for more\nspectacular behaviour multicast to the mbone - say the sd multicast\ngroup. Older Linux (1.3.x, 2.0 < 2.0.25) have the same bug but with\nICMP headers.  Solaris 2.x appears to be ok. Current OpenBSD/NetBSD\nappear to have this problem fixed.  He claims to have contacted\nCERT/CC about this vulnerability but unfortunately doesn't have any\ntracking numbers anymore.",
