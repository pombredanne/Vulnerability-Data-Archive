  "VendorRecordID": "BLUU-A6Y7QW",
  "VendorReferences": "None",
  "VendorStatement": "\"We are reaching out to Raysharp for firmware updates to further secure the older units but as the technology they were based on is now well and truly out of production this will take some time. Until such time as Swann are able to secure updated firmware for these models we recommend that the units are disconnected from the user's network to prevent malicious access. If the user requires remote access to their unit then we recommend that the user changes the numbers of the internal network \"Ports\" to use non-standard values that are not easily discovered and make random access very difficult. Swann's Tech Center can help guide users through this process if necessary.\""
