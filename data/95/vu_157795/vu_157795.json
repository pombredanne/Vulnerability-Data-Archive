  "Impact": "Attackers with previously established access to the filesystem may be able to manipulate Magic eDeveloper to write data to arbitrary file locations. Since Magic eDeveloper trusts certain files to contain safe executable code, overwriting these files can cause Magic eDeveloper to run arbitrary malicious code.",
