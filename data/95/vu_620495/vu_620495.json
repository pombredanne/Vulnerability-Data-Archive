  "Impact": "An intruder who exploits the vulnerability can execute arbitrary code as the 'oracle' user on UNIX systems, and in the Local System security context on Windows systems. In both cases, the attacker can gain gain control of database services on the victim machine; on Windows systems, the intruder can additionally gain administrative control of the operating system as well.",
