  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Restricting access to CUPS servers by using the CUPS configuration directives, firewall rules, or access control lists may mitigate this vulnerability. By default, cupsd listens on port 631/udp. Systems that use CUPS exclusively for local printing should set the Listen directive to localhost:631 in the cupsd configuration file to prevent remote systems from exploiting this vulnerability."
