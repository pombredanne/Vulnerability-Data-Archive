  "Description": "RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS), used in RuggedCom network infrastructure devices, contains a hard-coded user account named \"factory\" that cannot be disabled. The password for this account is based on the device's MAC address and can be reverse engineered easily (CWE-261: Weak Cryptography for Passwords). ROS also supports HTTP(S) and ssh services. In ROS 3.3.x, these services do not use the factory account. ROS does not appear to log successful or unsuccessful login attempts for the factory account. More information is available in \"Undocumented Backdoor Access to RuggedCom Devices\" and RuggedCom's security bulletin.",

  "Resolution": "According to RuggedCom's security bulletin, \"Version 3.10.1 of the ROS\u00ae firmware with security related fixes will be released on Tuesday May 22, 2012 and can be obtained by emailing support@ruggedcom.com. Other ROS\u00ae firmware versions containing the same security fixes (3.9.3, 3.8.5, 3.7.9 & 3.11.0) will be released over the next few weeks on a staggered basis as development and testing is completed.\" ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-12-146-01A confirms that ROS version 3.10.1 is no longer affected, and that versions 3.9.3,  3.8.5, and 3.7.9 are now available.",
