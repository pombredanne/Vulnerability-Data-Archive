  "Overview": "Multiple web browsers allow web sites to provide content to windows and frames in different domains. This behavior could contribute to the effectiveness of social engineering (phishing) attacks by misleading users about the actual souce of HTML content. In some cases, an attacker may be able to bypass browser security settings by executing active content in a domain where it is allowed to be run.",
