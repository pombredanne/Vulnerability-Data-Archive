  "ID": "VU#102795",
  "IDNumber": "102795",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. The code will be executed with the privileges of the application or service exploited via this vulnerability.",
  "Keywords": [
    "OpenSSL",
    "KEY_ARG overflow"
  ],
  "Overview": "OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in OpenSSL servers that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.",
  "References": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363",
  "Resolution": "OpenSSL servers should apply the patches provided by your vendors, or upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.6e. Note that applications statically linking to OpenSSL libraries may need to be recompiled with the corrected version of OpenSSL.",
