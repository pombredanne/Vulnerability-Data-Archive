The CSRF reported allows for a breach in the content filtering system resulting in complete compromise of an organizations Internet content filter and control over users internet traffic. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CVE-2012-3859\n(3) The Netsweeper Internet Filter WebAdmin Portal is vulnerable to SQL injection, in the sortorder and sortitem variables. An example of a vulnerable url is http://SERVER_Hostname/webadmin/reporter/view_details.php?sortitem=report_date&sortorder=asc&type=demand&id=1441.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Netsweeper Internet Filter WebAdmin Portal web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
