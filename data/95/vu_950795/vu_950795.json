  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\nTrend Micro Control Manager does not properly filter user-supplied input within the ad hoc query module. The successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result in arbitrary SQL command  input to the backend database. A remote attacker can execute SQL commands to upload and execute arbitrary code against the system.",
  "ID": "VU#950795",
  "IDNumber": "950795",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the Trend Micro Control Manager web interface can conduct a sql injection attack, which could be used to result in information leakage, arbitrary code execution and/or denial of service.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Trend Micro Control Manager web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
