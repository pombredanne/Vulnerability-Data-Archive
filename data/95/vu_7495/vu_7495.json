  "Workarounds": "This problem has been fixed in httpd-1.4. *However*, one must enable SECURE_LOGS in the httpd_1.4/Makefile; SECURE_LOGS is not enabled by default. NOTE: There is more than one version of httpd-1.4. They appear somewhat indistinguishable. The files in question are src/http_log.c which should have the sum of (04373, 13) and src/Makefile with the sum of (29868, 5)."
