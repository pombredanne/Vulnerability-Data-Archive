  "Description": "anyone can echo anything to /dev/log\nSee VU#17019.\n\nI discovered a fundamental weakness in syslogd that affected ALL\nUnix flavours running syslogd today\n\nWhen started, syslogd attaches itself to UDP port 514.  Here it\nlistens for logging information from across the network (LAN, WAN,\nwhatever).  When it receives a packet or two, syslogd dutifully\nprocesses the info in the packet and, if all is well, places the\ndata in one of many log files.  This is common knowledge, and\nfairly well-utilized.  After all, having a central log host (or\nhosts) is a big part of a Good Karma security setup.\n\nHowever, syslogd does not discriminate.  In fact, syslogd will\nprocess information from ANY source.  If the packet is properly\nformed, syslogd will gladly place the data in the log file with no\nvalidation checks whatsoever.  This is where the weakness arises.",
