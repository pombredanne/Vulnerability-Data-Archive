  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting Disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 833633 for information about securing the Local Machine Zone, and 315933 for information about displaying the Local Machine Zone (My Computer security zone) on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box. Note that disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Disabling this feature in the Local Machine Zone will reduce the functionality of some programs, including the Help and Support Center in Windows XP."
