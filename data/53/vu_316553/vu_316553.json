  "Description": "The Microsoft Windows kernel includes a driver (win32k.sys) that handles a variety of graphics processing tasks, including the processing of TrueType fonts. A vulnerability exists in the way this driver handles certain embedded TrueType fonts. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges on the affected system. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted font in a document attached to an email message or including the crafted font in a web page.",
