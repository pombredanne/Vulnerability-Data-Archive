  "Description": "IIS is a web server that comes with Microsoft Windows. IIS also includes FTP server functionality. The IIS FTP server fails to properly parse specially-crafted directory names. By issuing an FTP NLST (NAME LIST) command on a specially-named directory, an attacker may cause a stack buffer overflow. The attacker can create the specially-named directory if FTP is configured to allow write access using Anonymous account or another account that is available to the attacker.",

  "IDNumber": "276653",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server. For servers that allow anonymous file uploads, the attacker would typically be unauthenticated.",

  "Overview": "The Microsoft IIS FTP server contains a stack buffer overflow in the handling of directory names, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
