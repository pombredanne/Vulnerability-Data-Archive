  "Description": "Netfind service, telnet to one of the hosts listed and login\nas \"netfind\". No password required.",
  "ID": "VU#6053",
  "IDNumber": "6053",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Netfind allows a potential \"cracker\" to search for guest and\npossibly open default accountthroughout a whole domainin\nminutes. If any reason to trace the multiple connections,\nthey will be traced to the Netfind server rather than the host\nof the user who initiated the requests.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "per [#4569]:  Mike Schwartz\n\"modified Netfind so that the Restrictions list now allows the\nserver administrator to disable particular usernames from\nbeing searched. The server running on bruno.cs.colorado.edu\nnow disallows searches for \"guest\", \"telnet\", and \"tn3270\". I\nhave asked the other Netfind server administrators to do\nsimilarly. Also, I asked them to consider installing the RFC\n931 identd software at their site, so that it is possible for\nremote sites to identify that netfind@hostname caused the\ntraffic, and adjust to this traffic in their logging\nprocedures.\"",
