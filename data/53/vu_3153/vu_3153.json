  "Description": "One of the TTDB's RPC procedures (#7) takes an argument that is passed, by a series of subroutine calls, to strcpy().  If this argument is suitably crafted, it can cause a stack buffer overflow.  This permits a remote attacker to run arbitrary code as the uid of the TTDB process owner.\n\nA detailed list of the routines involved along with verifyier code is available in the SNI advisory ( #1998.20447).",
