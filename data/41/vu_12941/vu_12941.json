  "Description": "WinGate is a program that allows a LAN to connect to the Internet via\na single inexpensive dialup or ISDN connection.  It's a cheap way to\nput a small company on the Internet.\n\nA young hacker has found a vulnerability in\nWinGate gateway software that enables a hacker (or spammer) to telnet\ninto a WinGate firewall and then telnet back out again, thus\nlaundering his IP address for all intents and purposes.",
  "ID": "VU#12941",
  "IDNumber": "12941",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "No log is kept by WinGate, and the attack is thus traceable only back\nto the WinGate server - no further. Worse, this hacker has come up\nwith a netscanning program that goes out and finds open and vulnerable\nWinGate servers.",

  "Workarounds": "All you will have to do is bind the WWW, Telnet, FTP, News, and IRC\nproxies to the IP address of your internal NIC card in the WinGate\nmachine. You can accomplish this in WinGate V2 by right clicking on\nthe service in GateKeeper, selecting properties, and checking \"bind to\nspecific interface\" under the general tab. In this configuration WinGate will only accept connections on those\nports that originate on your internal LAN (you do not need to, or want\nto bind more than these proxies, as it can effect your access to\nGatekeeper, and may cause problems with your access through WinGate.)"
