  "Description": "Similar to the \"teardrop\" attack/vulnerability the nestea off by one IP frag vulnerability is caused by mishandling certain combinations of IP fragments. Protected kernal memory is overwritten which causes different behavior on different operating systems ranging from rebooting to a degradation in performance. The nestea exploit was first written when it was found that the Linux kernel had not completely repaired its vulnerability to the teardrop problem. As time passed on many more operating systems were found to be vulnerable to the Nestea attack. \n\nThis has been widely discussed on public mailing lists.",
