  "ID": "VU#898241",
  "IDNumber": "898241",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Microsoft BlnMgr Proxy COM object",
    "COM object"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Microsoft BlnMgr Proxy COM object fails to implement the methods required by the IDispatch interface, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, COM objects will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the document Securing Your Web Browser and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites."
