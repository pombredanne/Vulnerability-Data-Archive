  "Description": "Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the Cisco Resource Manager (CRM) create log files\nand temporary files on the management station which contain potentially\nsensitive information. These files are not protected using operating system\nmechanisms, and are therefore readable by all users of the system on which\nCRM is installed. The information exposed includes the usernames, passwords,\nand SNMP community strings used by CRM to gain access to the devices being\nmanaged.\n\nUsers who have access to the computer on which CRM is installed may gain\naccess to information which gives them unauthorized access to the managed\nrouters and switches.  This affects both Solaris and Windows NT systems.\n\nThere are workarounds for this problem, and a patch is available for CRM\n1.1. There is no patch for CRM 1.0.  Other than to install the patch, the\nmost effective solution for most installations is simply to deny untrusted\nusers any access to the computer on which CRM is installed or to its file\nsystems.",
