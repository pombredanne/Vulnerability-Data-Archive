  "Workarounds": "Workaround The following workaround is taken from RHSA-2002:194-18: A work around for this vulnerability is to remove the print filter for DVI files. The following commands, run as root, will accomplish this: rm -f /usr/share/printconf/mf_rules/mf40-tetex_filters\nrm -f /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/dvi-to-ps.fpi However, to fix the problem in the dvips utility as well as removing the print filter we recommend that all users upgrade these errata packages which contain a patch for this issue."
