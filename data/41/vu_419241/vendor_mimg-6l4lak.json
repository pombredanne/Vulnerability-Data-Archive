  "VendorStatement": "Products Affected: Reflection for Secure IT UNIX Server version 6.0\nReflection for Secure IT Windows Server version 6.0\nF-Secure SSH Server for Windows version 5.x\nF-Secure SSH Server for UNIX version 3.x through 5.x Problem Correction: AttachmateWRQ Reflection for Secure IT and F-Secure SSH Server users should install an upgrade, as specified in WRQ Tech Note 1882 ( http://support.wrq.com/techdocs/1882.html). The following workaround may prevent exploitation of the vulnerability: On UNIX Servers\n   1. Edit the SSH server's sshd2_config file: 1. Change the line\n            subsystem-sftp internal://sftp-server\n            to\n            subsystem-sftp sftp-server\n            Note: This change disallows the use of chroot. 2. Comment out the SftpSyslogFacility keyword line. Note: The line should begin with two \"pound\" signs, as in this example: ## SftpSyslogFacility LOCAL7\n   2. Restart the SSH server to read the changes in the configuration file. On Windows Servers\nThe only workaround is to disable the sftp subsystem as follows: 1. Edit the SSH server's sshd2_config file and comment out the subsystem-sftp line. Note: The line should begin with two \"pound\" signs, as in this example: ## subsystem-sftp \"fsshsftpd.exe\"\n   2. Restart the SSH server to read the change in the configuration file.
