  "Impact": "If this shared key is recovered by an attacker, that attacker may be able to decrypt all data encrypted using that key in all WebEOC installations. Such data that may be compromised may include system settings, emergency/medical data, and authentication information.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 by utilizing a key unique to every customer (these keys existed previously, but were not used). In addition, data encryption is now accomplished using Rinjndael-AES encryption algorithms and hashes are generated with SHA-512 algorithms. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
