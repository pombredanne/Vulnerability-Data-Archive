  "IDNumber": "758582",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could access the MusicCAST wireless network and data stored on the MusicCAST. If the MusicCAST is connected to a wired LAN, any resources on the LAN may be exposed via the wireless network.",

  "Overview": "The Yamaha MusicCAST MCX-1000 server wireless networking interface is enabled by default, cannot be disabled, and operates in Access Point mode. A remote attacker could access the MusicCAST wireless network and potentially any other network connected to the MusicCAST.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Enable WEP and other wireless security features To make it more difficult for an attacker to connect to the MusicCAST wireless network, use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). Note that vulnerabilities in WEP make it relatively easy for an attacker to determine the WEP key and connect to the WEP-protected wireless network. Current versions of the MusicCAST enable WEP by default and use a unique WEP key. The release notes state that Version Upgrade Vol. 4.1 supports \"Stealth mode to keep ESSID private or MAC address filter to protect the MusicCAST system from unauthorized access through wireless LAN.\"  These features make it somewhat more difficult for an attacker to access the wireless network. Disable wireless network interface If it is not needed, disable the wireless network interface."
