  "Description": "The advisory from Rapid7 states: Portable SDK for UPnP Devices unique_service_name() Buffer Overflows The libupnp library, originally known as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices and now maintained as the Portable SDK for UPnP Devices, is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious SSDP requests. This library is used by tens of millions of deployed network devices, of which approximately twenty million are exposed directly to the internet. In addition to network devices, many streaming media and file sharing applications are also exposed to attack through this library. This advisory does not address historic or current vulnerabilities in the HTTP and SOAP processing code of libupnp. Affected Versions\nVersions 1.2 (Intel SDK) and 1.2.1a - 1.8.0 (Portable SDK) are affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows in the unique_service_name() function, which is called to process incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. Additionally, versions prior to 1.6.17 are vulnerable to additional issues in the same function. Please see Appendix A for a review of the vulnerable code by version. Affected Vendors\nHundreds of vendors have used the libupnp library in their products, many of which are acting as the home routers for consumer networks. Any application linking to libupnp is likely to be affected and a list of confirmed vendors and products is provided in Appendix B. Proof of Concept\nThe following SSDP request will trigger a flaw that spans all known versions of libupnp. This will smash the return address on the stack around offset 300. This request should be sent to UDP port 1900 and may be easily spoofed. This request affects versions prior to 1.6.17 as well as 1.6.17 and above (1.8.0).
