  "Description": "When system programs such as login or other programs\nrun by init(8) have a umask of 000, they can produce core dumps\nand other files that are unprotected.  It also means that users'\ndefault is less rather than more protection.",
  "ID": "VU#4082",
  "IDNumber": "4082",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Depends on the site and situation. If a system program can be made to\nto produce a core dump, that file is readable and may contain\nsensitive data (e.g. login(8) and password info). If the core dump\nis wrtiable, it may allow a user to write on a root owned file\n(used to be a problem for at(1)).",
