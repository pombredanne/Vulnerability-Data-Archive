  "Description": "After we had problems with permissions granted via NIS netgroups\nI took a look in innetgr source of SunOS and found out that,\nif there are users with the matching first characters and double or more\nlast characters, innetgr will return 1 (in net group) for these users for\nthe same netgroups altough one of these users may not belong to that\nnetgroup.\n\nExample:\nlets say we have a user called root, which belongs to netgroup foo\nso, innetgr(\"foo\",NULL,\"root\",NULL) will return 1\nBUT also innetgr(\"foo\",NULL,\"rootty\",NULL) will return 1 !!!!\n\nTake note that user rootty doesn't even have to exist for this function\nto work. but if he does, all programs that use innetgr for user authorization\nwill work for him the same as for root.",
