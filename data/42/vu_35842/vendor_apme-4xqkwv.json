Redhat has identified a problem with the man package which also affects\nConectiva Linux. Conectiva Linux versions prior to 5.1 have already been\npatched. The man package has a script called makewhatis that is run weekly by the\ncron daemon as root. This script creates a directory in /tmp and some files\nunder it with predictable names, thus making it possible for a local\nattacker to alter any file in the system via symlink attacks. SOLUTION\nAll users of Conectiva Linux 5.1 should upgrade. Conectiva Linux versions prior to 5.1 have already been patched.
