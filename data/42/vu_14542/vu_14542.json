  "Description": "A security bug has been found in sendmail resulting from the ability\nof DNS to return any values, including newlines in host names.  This\nis actually one of a family of bugs that can attack many programs; the\ncorrect fix is in the resolver.  The following instructions will tell\nyou how to patch sendmail.\n\nThese fixes are critical.  This problem allows attackers to remotely\naccess any account except root.\n\nThe problem occurs when sendmail trusts a return value from DNS.\nIn most cases the worst that can happen is that a header will be\ntrashed, but if the information contains a newline and is written out\nto the queue file, commands can be put into the queue file.  The fix\nis to filter all information written to the queue file.  This requires\nchanges in two places.  If you have used my patch to fix the problem\nlisted in CERT Advisory CA-95:05, this will be a trivial patch.\n\nThe alternative fix would be to check any return values from DNS.\nHowever, given the large number of routines that may have values\nfrom DNS, I deemed it easier to check the values as they were going\ninto the queue file.",
