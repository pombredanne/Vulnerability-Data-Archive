  "Description": "The normal place where a program dumps core, core in the\ncurrent working directory, can be replaced by a sym link\nthat points to an important place, /.rhosts for example.\nBy getting /usr/bin/ppl to dump core and by insuring that\nthat core image contains the following by giving this\ninformation as a command line argument:\n\n<newline>\n+ +\n<newline>\n\nthe target file, /.rhosts in this case, will be overwritten\nwith said core image.  Since the core image contains the + +\nstring on a line by itself, the rlogind/rshd allow connections\nto that machine from *anywhere*.\n\nThe problems are many:\n\n1 - A program that obtains priviledges, in this case by being\nsetuid (root), is able to dump core but should not.  This\nis an operating system error.\n\n2 - Should the core dump part of the kernel follow symbolic\nlinks?  HP does and so does Solaris 2.5.1.\n\n3 - There is a buffer overflow on the ppl program that should\nbe fixed.\n\n4 - The ruserok subroutine that looks at the /.rhosts file (and\nothers) should react differently in the face of binary data.",
