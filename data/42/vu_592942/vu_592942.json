  "Description": "SearchBlox versions 7.4 Build 1 and older contain multiple vulnerabilities that allow an unauthenticated attacker to compromise the integrity of the system and the confidentiality of its data. Specifically: CWE-77: Command Injection - CVE-2013-3590\nActive content, such as JSP pages, can be uploaded to http://HOSTNAME:8080/searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html. This can be done by submitting the content using the form and using a client proxy to ensure that the \"Content-Type\" for the uploaded file is \"image/jpeg\". The attacker can then visit the uploaded content and enable its execution. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2013-3597\nUsernames and passwords can be read from the database by visiting http://HOSTNAME:8080/searchblox/servlet/CollectionListServlet?action=getList&orderBy=colName&direction=asc CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path - CVE-2013-3598\nFilesystem data can be remotely overwritten by sending an HTTP POST request to /searchblox/servlet/CreateTemplateServlet and modifying the \"name\" parameter to point to an arbitrary system file, such as \"../../../../../etc/shadow\". The CVSS scores reflect the command injection attack.",
