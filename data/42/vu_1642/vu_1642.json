  "Description": "In Digital Unix (OSF/1) v3.x, there is a security vulnerability in\nthe /usr/tcb/bin/dxchpwd program. The dxchpwd is installed as part\nof the C2 security package. The dxchpwd can be used to overwrite\nany file, or create a file anywhere on the system causing a\npossible denial of service and possibly lead to root access.\n\nBackground: dxchpwd is part of the C2 security package and is\nsetuid root. It's a GUI interface for a users to change\ntheir passwds. As far as I know, all Digital Unix v3.x\nversions are vulnerable, and possibly 4.x.\n\nDetails: When dxchpwd is run, it creates a log file\n/tmp/dxchpwd.log which is root owned and mode 600. If the\nlog file doesn't exist, it can be symlinked to any existing\nfile, or new file on the system. New files are created root\nowned, mode 600.  Existing files retain their permissions\nand ownership, but their contents are overwritten. If a\nuser then attempts to change a passwd, a message similar to\nthe following is written to the log file:\n\nUnknown SIA Prompt: (* Permission denied.\n*) rendition 6\n\nIn this case, if /.rhosts were symlinked to /tmp/dxchpwd.log, then\na host known as Unknown could possibly gain root access.",
