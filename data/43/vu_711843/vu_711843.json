  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to convince a user to access a specially crafted HTML document, such as an Internet web page or HTML email message, could execute arbitrary script with privileges of the user in the security context of the Local Machine Zone. This technique could be used to read certain types of files in known locations on the user's system. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities (VU#626395, VU#25249), the attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.",

  "Overview": "Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) includes several local HTML resources that contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These resources use the dialogArguments property of dialog frames insecurely, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary script in the Local Machine Zone.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting Active scripting is required to open a modal dialog frame and populate dialogArguments, which is a proven and well-publicized method of attack. At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, or any other email client that uses Internet Explorer or the WebBrowser control to render HTML. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Apply the Outlook Email Security Update Another way to effectively disable Active scripting in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Update HTML Help To protect against arbitrary command execution, install an updated version of HTML Help (811630). As described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-015, the updated HHCtrl ActiveX control disables the Shortcut command in a compiled help file that has been opened with the showHelp method: Only supported protocols [http:, https:, file:, ftp:, ms-its:, or mk:@MSITStore:] can be used with showHelp to open a web page or help (chm) file. The shortcut function supported by HTML Help will be disabled when the help file is opened with showHelp This will not affect the shortcut functionality if the same CHM file is opened by the user manually by double-clicking on the help file, or by through an application on the local system using the HTMLHELP( ) API. Note that the patches referenced in MS03-004 and MS03-015 completely disable the showHelp method. After installing either one of these patches, Internet Explorer will not be able to open help files. Restrict HTML Help commands Restrict the execution of the Shortcut and WinHelp HTML Help commands to specified folders, or disable the commands entirely. As in the previous recommendation, this technique will protect against arbitrary command execution via HTML Help. Details are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 810687."
