  "Overview": "The CERT/CC has begun receiving reports of an input validation vulnerability in the rpc.statd program being exploited. This program is included, and often installed by default, in several popular Linux distributions. Please see the vendors section of this document for specific information regarding affected distributions. More information about this vulnerability is available at the following public URLs: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2000-0666\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1480 The rpc.statd program passes user-supplied data to the syslog() function as a format string. If there is no input validation of this string, a malicious user can inject machine code to be executed with the privileges of the rpc.statd process, typically root.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade your version of rpc.statd\nPlease see the vendors section of this document for more information about the availability of program updates specific to your system. If you are running a vulnerable version of rpc.statd, the CERT/CC encourages you to apply appropriate vendor patches. After making any updates, be sure to restart the rpc.statd service. Disable the rpc.statd service\nIf an update cannot be applied, the CERT/CC recommends disabling the rpc.statd service. We advise proceeding with caution, however, as disabling this process can interfere with NFS functionality. Block unneeded ports at your firewall\nAs a good security practice in general, the CERT/CC recommends blocking unneeded ports at your firewall. This option does not remedy the vulnerability, but does prevent outside intruders from exploiting it. In particular, block port 111 (portmapper), as well as the port on which rpc.statd is running, which may vary.",
