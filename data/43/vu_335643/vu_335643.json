  "Overview": "According to a Red Hat Security Bulletin, vipw, from the util-linux package in Red Hat Linux 7.1, included a new option that allowed editing of the /etc/shadow file as well as /etc/passwd. However, this option did not take measures to ensure that the file remained only readable by root.",

  "Resolution": "Updates to Red Hat 7.1 are as follows: SRPMS: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/SRPMS/util-linux-2.10s-13.7.src.rpm alpha: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/alpha/util-linux-2.10s-13.7.alpha.rpm i386: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/i386/util-linux-2.10s-13.7.i386.rpm ia64: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/ia64/util-linux-2.10s-13.7.ia64.rpm",
