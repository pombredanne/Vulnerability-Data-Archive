  "Workarounds": "Do not use affected versions of the application The features and services provided by the application are likely accessible via the Space Coast Credit Union web site. By using a web browser to access those resources, you may avoid situations where SSL is not validated. Avoid untrusted networks Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack."
