  "ID": "VU#707100",
  "IDNumber": "707100",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Malicious scripting, HTML and Active Content can be executed in the victim's browser. This attack could be used to gain sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, address book entries and any arbitrary information the user inputs. This may also lead to the theft of credentials.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Yahoo",
    "Excite",
    "Mail.com",
    "cross-site scripting",
    "malicious characters",
    "double encoded active content"
  ],
  "Overview": "An attacker can send a specially crafted email message to a victim containing malicious scripting (JavaScript, VBScript, JScript, etc.), active content, or potentially HTML. When a victim views the message with scripting enabled, the victim's browser will then interpret this javascript which can lead to several impacts.",
  "References": "http://www.finjan.com/news/press_show.cfm?press_release_id=124",
  "Resolution": "Please review the Systems Affected section to determine if your vendor is vulnerable, and whether they have taken any action to remedy this vulnerability.",
  "Revision": 13,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "Thanks to Finjan Software for reporting this vulnerability.",
  "Title": "Multiple web-based email services fail to filter malicious characters when the message contains cascading style sheet character escaping",
  "US-CERTTechnicalAlert": "",
  "VRDA_D1_DirectReport": "",
  "VRDA_D1_Impact": "",
  "VRDA_D1_Population": "",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Do not open messages that you feel may contain untrustworthy content. Even if the message originates from a known person. Also, you can set your browser's security settings to disable scripting and active content. This will limit, but not mitigate the attack vectors for this vulnerability, but will also decrease the functionality of your service."
