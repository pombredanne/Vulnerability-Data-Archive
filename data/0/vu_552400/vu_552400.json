  "Overview": "FreeS/WAN based IKE applications do not properly validate certificate chain Self signed certificates (Issuer and Subject have the same identical Distinguished Name) are typically used to represent a Root certificate issued by a Certification Authority (CA). A Self signed certificate that is not the CA lacks the 'flow of trust' that is typically part of the public key infrastructure.",

  "Resolution": "Apply updated X.509 patches or install updated versions. For Openswan -- Update to version 2.1.4 or 1.0.6. See  http://www.openswan.org/code/ For  strongSwan -- Update to version 2.1.3. See http://www.strongswan.org/download.htm For FreeS/WAN -- The FreeS/WAN project is reportedly no longer active. However, updated X.509 patches should be available.",
