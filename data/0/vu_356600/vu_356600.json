  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute script in the Local Machine Zone. Script that executes in the Local Machine Zone can be used to download and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may obtain full access to web content in another domain, which may reside in a different security zone. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This includes the ability to spoof or modify web content, access website information such as cookies, or retrieve data from an encrypted HTTPS connection. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see CERT Advisory CA-2000-02.",

  "Overview": "A cross-domain vulnerability exists in the DHTML Editing ActiveX control. An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the Local Machine Zone or read or modify data in other domains. For example, the attacker could execute arbitrary commands with parameters, download and execute arbitrary code, read cookies, spoof content, or modify form behavior.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the DHTML Editing Control Disable the DHTML Editing Control by setting the kill bit as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 240797. The CLSID for the DHTML Editing Control is: {2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A} Note that disabling the DHTML Editing Control may prevent Outlook Web Access (OWA) from functioning properly. Disable Active scripting and ActiveX Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, the DHTML Editing Control will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 833633 for information about securing the Local Machine Zone, and 315933 for information about displaying the Local Machine Zone (My Computer security zone) on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box. Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Disabling these features in the Local Machine Zone will reduce the functionality of some programs, including the Help and Support Center in Windows XP. Install Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) Microsoft Windows XP SP2 includes a feature called Local Machine Zone Lockdown, as well as other improvements. The Local Machine Zone Lockdown prevents Internet Explorer and several other programs from evaluating script in the Local Machine Zone. While this does not remove the vulnerability, it does help prevent an attacker from executing script in the Local Machine Zone. Apply the Outlook Email Security Update Another way to effectively disable Active scripting in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements. Read and send email in plain text format Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. <br> <a name=\"alt_browser\"> Use a different web browser\nThere are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, local file system (Local Machine Zone) trust, the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) document object model (in particular, proprietary DHTML features), the HTML Help system, MIME type determination, the graphical user interface (GUI), and ActiveX. These technologies are implemented in operating system libraries that are used by IE and many other programs to provide web browser functionality. IE is integrated into Windows to such an extent that vulnerabilities in IE frequently provide an attacker significant access to the operating system. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser, especially when viewing untrusted HTML documents (e.g., web sites, HTML email messages). Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as proprietary DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control (WebOC), or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML)."
