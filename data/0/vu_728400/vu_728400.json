  "Resolution": "According to Research In Motion: Research In Motion has previously implemented a fix to address the reset issue described above in the most recent handheld software version 3.8 and version 4.0. RIM also plans to implement a further safeguard at the server level in BlackBerry Enterprise Server version 4.0, as well as future revisions of BlackBerry Enterprise Server version 3.6 for Microsoft Exchange and BlackBerry Enterprise Server for IBM Lotus Domino version 2.2, that will prevent artificially large or problematic meeting request messages from being delivered to the handheld, thereby eliminating the need for handheld software to be upgraded to version 3.8 or version 4.0.",
