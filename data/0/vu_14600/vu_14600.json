  "Description": "When run while the CDROM drive is already in use by another\nprocess, 'cdrom' tries to discover the name of that process and\nreport it to the user.  A run of 'strings' on the cdrom binary\nreveals what looks like a system() call of ps(1) and other tools,\nusing relative pathnames:\n\nps -p %s -f | tail -1 | tr -s ' ' | cut -f9 -d' '\n\nEvidently 'cdrom' leaves its inherited path unsanitized, because it\ncan be fooled into executing bogus versions of these programs.",

  "Impact": "/usr/sbin/Confidence/cdrom is setuid root, and can be easily\ntricked into executing arbitrary commands. Unprivileged local\nusers on a machine with a CDROM drive installed can exploit this\nbehavior to gain root privileges.",
