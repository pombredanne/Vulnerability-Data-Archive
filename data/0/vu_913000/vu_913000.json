  "Description": "CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls - CVE-2015-8279 An undocumented PHP request may be used to read arbitrary files from the system. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2015-8280 The interface provides too many details in errors messages, which may allow an attacker to determine user credentials. CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm - CVE-2015-8281 The firmware filesystem uses a weak custom encryption scheme based only on simple XOR operations. Vendors should not attempt to implement their own cryptographic methods. According to the researchers, the Samsung SRN-1670D (Web Viewer Version 1,0,0,193, Date Created 2013.10.26) is affected; other Samsung SRN model cameras may be affected. This device appears to be manufactured by another company named Hanwha. More information can be found in the researchers' blog.",
