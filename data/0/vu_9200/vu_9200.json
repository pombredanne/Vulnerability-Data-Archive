  "Workarounds": "Turn off rpc.pcnfsd or isolate it on a machine that users cannot\nlogin to. The only advice seem to be to shut down the pcnsfd. Another\npossible reaction might be to have a deidcated pcnfsd-server\nwhere no user can login (because you need to have login access\non the target machine to use the exploit script). The exploit script says, that almost all UNIX variants running\npcnsfd are vulnerable, but it has not yet been tested on other\nsystems. Flash - There is a suggested fix for rpc.pcnfsd - see INFO#95.22157. Sun has made patches available: Solaris 2.4, 2.5 (Sparc)\t103095-02\nSolaris 2.4, 2.5 (X86)\t\t103457-01\nSunOS 4.1.X\t\t\t103096-02"
