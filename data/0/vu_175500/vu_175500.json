  "Workarounds": "Disable Snort Back Orifice preprocessor Disabling the Snort Back Orifice preprocessor will mitigate this vulnerability. However, without the Snort preprocessor, the Snort sensor will not detect or prevent Back Orifice traffic. Snort suggests the following steps to disable the Back Orifice preprocessor: The Back Orifice preprocessor can be disabled by commenting out the line \"preprocessor bo\" in snort.conf. This can be done in any text editor using the following procedure: 1. Locate the line \"preprocessor bo\"\n2. Comment out this line by preceding it with a hash (#). The new line will look like \"#preprocessor bo\"\n3. Save the file\n4. Restart snort"
