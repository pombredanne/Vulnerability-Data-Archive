  "Vendor": "xpdf",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "MAPG-8ECL8X",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib. To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the \"--with-t1-library=no\" flag to the\nconfigure command: ./configure --with-t1-library=no ..... To double-check, run \"xpdf --help\". The \"-freetype\" option should be\nlisted, and the \"-t1lib\" option should NOT be listed. That indicates\nthat Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib. With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize\nType 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is\nas good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems."
