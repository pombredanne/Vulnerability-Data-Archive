  "Description": "Plesk Panel contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities which may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code as the root user. Special-case rules in Plesk's custom version of Apache suexec allow execution of arbitrary code as an arbitrary user id above a certain minimum value. In addition, several administrative or system accounts have a user ID above this minimum. Plesk's /usr/sbin/suexec binary (the binary may be present in additional locations, always with suexec in the filename) always allows the binary 'cgi-wrapper', bypassing restrictions on the ownership of the file to be called. Since cgi-wrapper's function is to execute a PHP script based on environment variables (and suexec does not sanitize these environment variables) this allows execution of arbitrary PHP code with a user id above a minimum user ID value that is hardcoded in the suid binary. CVE-2013-0132 The program /usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/wrapper allows the user psaadm to execute various administrative scripts with root privileges. Some of these scripts call external programs without specifying the full path. By specifying a malicious PATH environment variable, an attacker can cause the administrative scripts to call his own program instead of the intended system program. CVE-2013-0133\nThe CVSS scores below apply to CVE-2013-0133.",

  "Workarounds": "Parallel's Plesk Panel advisory states the following workaround: Disable mod_php, mod_python, and mod_perl and use Fast CGI and/or CGI, which are not affected by this security vulnerability. Below is the example on how to switch mod_php to fast_cgi for all existing domains: # mysql -uadmin --skip-column-names -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` psa -e \"select name from domains where htype = 'vrt_hst';\" | awk -F \\| '{print $1}' | while read a; do /usr/local/psa/bin/domain -u $a -php_handler_type fastcgi; done\nAfter the fix for the issue is published, Parallels still recommends that you avoid using these Apache modules (mod_php, mod_python, and mod_perl) and instead use Fast CGI or CGI modes for improved security on Apache. For additional details, please refer to Parallels Plesk Panel for Linux Advanced Administration Guide, Enhancing Security."
