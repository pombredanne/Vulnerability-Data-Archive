  "Description": "CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\nDell Latitude E6430, E6500, E6410, and possibly other Latitude models contain a vulnerability which may allow malicious code to bypass write protections to the BIOS. Sam Cornwell of The MITRE Corporation reports: The BIOS_CNTL register found in Intel chipsets is used to protect the BIOS from being written after boot. When bit 1 (BIOSLE) is set in this register, an SMI is generated whenever there is an attempt to set bit 0 (BIOSWE). The SMI handler is then responsible for blocking the change to BIOSWE (keeping it cleared) in order to keep the BIOS read-only. The GBL_SMI_EN bit, found in the SMI_EN register, can be cleared in order disable SMIs. This effectively disables the BIOSLE/BIOSWE protection mechanism until SMIs are reenabled. GBL_SMI_EN can be locked on by setting the SMI_LOCK bit (found in the GEN_PMCON_1 register). However, we have found that many models do not have the SMI_LOCK bit set and are therefore vulnerable to this type of attack.",
