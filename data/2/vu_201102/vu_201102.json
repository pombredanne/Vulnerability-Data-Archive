  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Use least privilege Run software under a user account with the least privilege possible. Accessing IO Ports directly or installing drivers generally requires root or Administrator privileges. Applications that do not run with root or Administrator privileges may not be able to modify hardware parameters via the SMBus. Do not execute untrusted software Do not run untrusted programs. Malicious software can not only cause loss of data or privacy, but in certain circumstances it may be able to cause physical damage to a computer."
