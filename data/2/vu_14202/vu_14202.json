  "Description": "rlogin uses strcpy to copy the TERM environment variable to an\ninternal buffer, potentially overflowing that buffer.  If TERM\nwere set properly, one could overwrite the stack and execute\na program as root.  rlogin at the time of doing the copy is\nstill running as root.\n\nSince strcpy is used, the contents of the TERM environment\nvariable must be carefully constructed so as not to not contain\na null character.",
