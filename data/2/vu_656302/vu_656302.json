  "Description": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2013-6952\nBelkin Wemo Home Automation firmware contains a hard-coded cryptographic key and password. An attacker may be able to extract the key and password to sign a malicious firmware update. CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check - CVE-2013-6951\nBelkin Wemo Home Automation devices do not have a local Certificate store to verify the integrity of SSL connections. CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - CVE-2013-6950\nBelkin Wemo Home Automation firmware distribution feed does not use SSL encryption. CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy') - CVE-2013-6949\nBelkin Wemo Home Automation devices use STUN & TURN protocols. An attacker with control of one Wemo device may be able to use the STUN & TURN protocols to relay connections to any other Wemo device. CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') - CVE-2013-6948\nBelkin Wemo Home Automation API server contains a XML injection vulnerability. The peerAddresses API can be attacked through XML injection, which may reveal the contents of system files. Additional details may be found in the IOActive advisory.",

  "Resolution": "Update Apps and Firmware Users with the most recent firmware release (version 3949) are not at risk for malicious firmware attacks or remote control or monitoring of WeMo devices from unauthorized devices. Belkin urges such users to download the latest app from the App Store (version 1.4.1) or Google Play Store (version 1.1.2) and then upgrade the firmware version through the app. Specific fixes Belkin has issued include: 1)      An update to the WeMo API server on November 5, 2013 that prevents an XML injection attack from gaining access to other WeMo devices. 2)      An update to the WeMo firmware, published on January 24, 2014, that adds SSL encryption and validation to the WeMo firmware distribution feed, eliminates storage of the signing key on the device, and password protects the serial port interface to prevent a malicious firmware attack 3)      An update to the WeMo app for both iOS (published on January 24, 2014) and Android (published on February 10, 2014) that contains the most recent firmware update.",
