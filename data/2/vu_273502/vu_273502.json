  "Description": "EasyVista contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in the EasyVista single sign-on feature that does not use encoded values. If an attacker can obtain the login names for any users with access to the application, then the attacker may be able to bypass authentication using a specifically crafted URL. An example URL is below: hxxp://servername/index.php?url_account=account_number&SSPI_HEADER=windows_domain\\username",
  "ID": "VU#273502",
  "IDNumber": "273502",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If an attacker can obtain the login name of an application administrator, they may be able to perform any function an administrator can. The application contains an inventory database with sensitive information that would be useful to an attacker to expand their attack to the rest of the network.",
