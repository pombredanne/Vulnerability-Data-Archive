  "ID": "VU#768702",
  "IDNumber": "768702",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to inject malicious content into a web or browser cache, to perform cross-site scripting attacks, to hijack user and session data, or to bypass content protection mechanisms. These flaws are platform independent.",
  "Keywords": [
    "response splitting",
    "HTTP response",
    "squid",
    "cache poisoning",
    "cross site scripting",
    "xss",
    "session hijacking"
  ],
  "Overview": "Multiple interconnected devices process valid HTTP request headers inconsistently and in this may manner may allow a remote attacker to poison a cache, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and hijack user sessions. Attackers may use these flaws to launch a class of attacks referred to as HTTP response splitting.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not follow unsolicited links Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. Check Certificates US-CERT recommends that prior to providing any sensitive information over a secure (HTTPS) connection, you check the name recorded in the certificate to be sure that it matches the name of the site to which you think you are connecting."
