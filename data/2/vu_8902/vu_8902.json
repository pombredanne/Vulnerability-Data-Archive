  "Description": "the beginning of inc.c, while running as root, calls\nm_find(), which calls m_getdefs(), which calls makedir() to\ncreate the Mail directory if it doesn't exist.  makedir() calls\nthe mkdir command to create the directory (correctly resetting gid\nand uid before the execl), but then does\nif ((cp = m_find (\"folder-protect\")) == NULL)\ncp = foldprot;\n(void) chmod (dir, atooi (cp));",

I do endorse\nmoving toward POP servers, esepcially when Sun's mailtool supports it -\nthen people could read mail from the convenience of their own Sun\nwithout having to have the mailbox be on the unbackedup sun disk).\""
