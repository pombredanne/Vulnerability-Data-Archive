  "Description": "The System Error Notification Broker (syserr) program is part of the\nDesktop System Monitor which monitors the system for user defined\nevents and then provides notification and/or action when those events\noccur.\n\nAs part of normal operation, the syserr program manipulates certain\nhistory and configuration files.  A security issue was found in\nthese file operations.\n\nRequires a local account to be exploited.\n\nUtilizing the syserr vulnerability, random files can be created\nand corrupted.",

  "Workarounds": "Although patches are available for this issue, it is realized that\nthere may be situations where installing the patches immediately may\nnot be possible. The steps below can be used to remove the vulnerability by removing\nthe permissions of the syserr and permissions programs. 1) Become the root user on the system. % /bin/su -\nPassword: 2) Change the permissions on the programs. # /bin/chmod 500 /usr/sbin/syserr\n# /bin/chmod 500 /usr/lib/desktop/permissions *** NOTE *** Removing the permissions from these programs\nwill prevent non-root users and programs from\nusing these programs. 3) Return to previous level. # exit"
