  "Description": "tar on Solaris 2.1 x86 sometimes includes part of\n/etc/passwd in garbage appended to tar archives.",
  "ID": "VU#14430",
  "IDNumber": "14430",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Information from a site's /etc/passwd file may be widely distributed,\nespecially if the tar file is part of a vendor's distribution. Solaris by default uses shadow passwords so at least it is unlikely\nthat a site's encrypted passwords would be made available. However, account names and any info in the gcos field such as user\nnames may be present in the tar file.",

  "Workarounds": "paul de bra writes: tar needs to be fixed to no longer append\ngarbage to archives. garbage appended when\nblocking factor is used needs to be garbage,\ne.g. nulls, not information from files. workaround: use gnu tar cert suggested workaround. none until fix from sun. sites acquire prior versions of tar."
