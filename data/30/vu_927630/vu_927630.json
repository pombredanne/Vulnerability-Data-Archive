  "Workarounds": "Workarounds NetScreen's advisory provides the following mitigation steps for this vulnerability: Either of the following options will enable 128-bit AES encryption between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices running ScreenOS 5.0: (1) Add the following line in the devSvr.cfg file located in the /usr/netscreen/DevSvr/var/ folder, then restart DevSvr services: devSvrManager.cryptoKeyLength 128 - -OR- (2) As root, run the script 'addCryptoParam.sh', which is available on the NetScreen-Security Manager downloads page at www.netscreen.com/cso, then restart DevSvr services. NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 Feature Pack 1, available at a later date, will also address this issue."
