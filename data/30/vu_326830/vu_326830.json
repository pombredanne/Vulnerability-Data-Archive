  "Description": "CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') NAS4Free version 9.1.0.1.804 and possibly earlier versions contain a remote code execution vulnerability. NAS4Free allows an authenticated user to post PHP code to an HTTP script and have the code executed remotely. By default, NAS4Free runs with root privileges. A remotely authenticated attacker can send an HTTP POST request that contains a malicious PHP file which can cause the script to run directly on the machine. For more details, please see Tod Beardsley's Rapid7 blog post.",
