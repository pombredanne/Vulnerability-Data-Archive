  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "NetBSD has two codebases for crypto software, a legacy of the US's export laws until recently (and also some patent issues). The crypto-intl tree intended for use by those outside the US was not affected. For the crypto-us tree, \nkrb5 was not affected \nkrb4 was affected, and has been fixed in NetBSD-current since Jeff's announcement; this fix is making it's way into the 1.4.x release branch. We will release an advisory and patches shortly. In summary, users of NetBSD releases 1.4.2 and earlier or -current up until yesterday, who have installed the crypto-us \"secr\" set and who have enabled kerberos4, are vulnerable."
