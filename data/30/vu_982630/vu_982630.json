  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Microsoft recommends the following workarounds for users who are unable to apply the patch: Block ports 7007 and 7778 at your firewall. If you do not stream media over TCP to the Internet, you can block TCP port 7007. Also, block port 7778, which is used to administer Windows Media Services through Windows Media Monitor Service. Windows Media Services uses these ports. By blocking these ports at the firewall, you can help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Impact of Workaround: If you block port 7007, you will prevent multicast streams and the enabling of playlists from functioning across the firewall. If you block port 7778, you will prevent administrative functions from functioning across the firewall. Administer your Windows Media Services from the console or through a Terminal Services session. Administer your Windows Media Services servers directly from the console or through a Terminal Services session. If you do this, you will not be affected by any successful denial of service attempts against Windows Media Monitor Service. The reason for this is that the service can still be accessed and used from the desktop of the system that is hosting Windows Media Services even after a successful denial of service attack has been taken place. Impact of Workaround: None. Stop, disable, or remove Windows Media Station Service. Stop, disable, or remove Windows Media Station Service. Impact of Workaround: Stopping, disabling, or removing Windows Media Station Service will cause multicast streams or the enabling of playlists to not function. Disable or remove Windows Media Monitor Service. Disable or remove Windows Media Monitor Service. Impact of Workaround: Disabling or removing Windows Media Monitor Service will prevent the possibility of administering Windows Media Services."
