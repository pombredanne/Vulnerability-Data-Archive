In addition, the MyBrocade.com  web site does not use OpenSSL and is not \nvulnerable to this issue. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not \nproperly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to \nobtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that \ntrigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to \nd1_both.c and t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug. https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160 RISK ASSESSMENT\nThere is no risk using Brocade products\nSYMPTOMS\nNot applicable.
