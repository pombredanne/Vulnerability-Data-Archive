  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis vulnerability is addressed in version 3 of the System Requirements Lab software. This version is available on the systemrequirementlab.com web server. This version of the ActiveX control restricts which domains can call the methods provided by the control. The primary ActiveX version of the software has also been disabled in Internet Explorer with the update for Microsoft Security Advisory (956391). Note that this update does not prevent the vulnerable Java version of the control from being used, nor does it disable every vulnerable version of the ActiveX control. Please see the CERT/CC Vulnerability Analysis Blog for more details about vulnerable Java applets.",

  "Workarounds": "Block outbound requests from the System Requirements Lab software It may be possible to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by filtering network requests from the System Requirements Lab software. Updates that occur using HTTP will contain the HTTP header: User-Agent: SRL\nWhen the System Requirements Lab software retrieves an update using the FTP protocol, it will use the following pattern: USER anonymous\nPASS IEUser@\nSIZE //system.xml\nRETR //system.xml\nCWD //system.xml\nDisable the System Requirements Lab ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer The vulnerable ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {67A5F8DC-1A4B-4D66-9F24-A704AD929EEE} {BE833F39-1E0C-468C-BA70-25AAEE55775E} {BE833F39-1E0C-468C-BA70-25AAEE55775F} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for these controls: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{67A5F8DC-1A4B-4D66-9F24-A704AD929EEE}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{BE833F39-1E0C-468C-BA70-25AAEE55775E}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{BE833F39-1E0C-468C-BA70-25AAEE55775F}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0 Disable Java This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling Java in your web browser.
