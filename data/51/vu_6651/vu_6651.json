  "Workarounds": "1. Disable hostname lookups in network services such as HTTP and SMTP if possible. 2. Enable caching of bad addresses, which is disabled by default. 3. Increase the number of threads available to lookupd. More detail on suggested workarounds is available from: http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/Lookupd.html"
