  "Impact": "A malicious program can circumvent the automatic intrusion blocking feature and gain internet access without the user's knowledge.",
  "Keywords": [
    "zone alarm",
    "firewall"
  ],
  "Overview": "Zone Alarm is a personal firewall application. It contains a feature called \"automatic intrusion blocking\" to prohibit applications from accessing the internet without prior approval from the user. Due to the way that Zone Alarm Pro notifies the user of an application's attempt to access the internet, a malicious program can take actions on behalf of the user with out the user's knowledge, and allow itself to access the internet.",

  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
  "Revision": 17,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "The CERT/CC wishes to thank John B Davis, who discovered this vulnerability and reported to the vendor and the CERT/CC.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "We recommend that you install Zone Alarm such that it runs as an administrative service for Windows NT/2000, and regularly check the list of applications that Zone Alarm permits Internet access to and remove unknown/unwanted programs. Likewise, any applications that appear several times in the list should also be considered highly suspect as the hostile application may attempt to disguise itself as a well-known application."
