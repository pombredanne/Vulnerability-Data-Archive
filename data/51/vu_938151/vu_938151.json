  "Description": "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are used to improve website performance and scalability by connecting a user to geographically nearby server for content. CDNs typically operate in two modes, a \"push\" mode allowing a user to upload content to the CDN for later distribution, or a \"pull\" mode which effectively acts as a reverse proxy. In some scenarios, a malicious user can manipulate \"pull mode\" forwarding to forward in an internal loop within the CDN. This effectively launches a denial of service (DoS) attack against the CDN by consuming large amounts of resources. More information is provided in the researcher's conference paper.",
  "ID": "VU#938151",
  "IDNumber": "938151",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to create a denial of service condition in CDNs, preventing access to hosted content.",
  "Keywords": [
    "cdn",
    "dos",
    "resource exhaustion",
    "CWE-400"
  ],
  "Overview": "Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) may in some scenarios be manipulated into a forwarding loop, which consumes server resources and causes a denial of service (DoS) on the network.",
  "References": "https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/blogs-media/forwarding-loop-attacks-content-delivery-networks.pdf",
  "Resolution": "The researchers and CERT have reached out to known affected CDNs to inform them of this attack. CDNs are implementing their own counter-measures to this attack. If you are an employee of a CDN, the CERT/CC encourages you to review the researcher's conference paper to determine if your CDN may be impacted.",
