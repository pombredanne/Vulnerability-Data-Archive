  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "Akamai Technologies, Inc.",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "GWAN-A7LNGU",
  "VendorReferences": "https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/03/akamai-response-to-forwarding-loop-issue.html\nhttps://community.akamai.com/community/security-research-and-intelligence/blog/2016/03/03/akamai-response-to-forwarding-loop-issue",
  "VendorStatement": "\"Akamai is aware of the research paper titled \"Forwarding-Loop Attacks in\nContent Delivery Networks\n<https://community.akamai.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inter\nnetsociety.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblogs-media%2Fforwarding-loop-att\nacks-content-delivery-networks.pdf> \" published by Jianjun Chen et. al on\nFeb. 29. We have reviewed the researchers' findings, and are confident that\nwe already have adequate counter-measures in place to thwart any attempt to\nuse Akamai as an attack vector in the manner described by the paper. The paper describes four types of forwarding-loop attacks against CDNs: self-loop, intra-CDN loop, inter-CDN loop and dam flooding. The paper\nacknowledges that Akamai is not vulnerable to the first two. The third\nattack (the \"inter-CDN loop attack\") is described as a looping between\nmultiple CDNs. Finally, the fourth -- \"dam flooding\" -- is described as\ncoupling \"forwarding-loop attacks with timely controlled HTTP responses to\nsignificantly increase damage.\" While Akamai does not publicly disclose or discuss our security\ncountermeasures, we would like to reiterate that we have sufficient\ncountermeasures in place to detect and defend against all these attacks, as\nwell as substantial capacity to absorb traffic spikes. If you have any\nadditional questions/concerns, please reach out to your Akamai\nrepresentative.\""
