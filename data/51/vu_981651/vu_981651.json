  "Impact": "The victim will be presented with information which the compromised site did not wish their visitors to be subjected. This vulnerability could be used to \"sniff\" sensitive data from within the web page, including passwords, credit card numbers, and any arbitrary information the user inputs.",

  "Overview": "Web servers that use the Resin Java Servlet Container, versions 1.2.3 and earlier, are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script(JavaScript, VBScript, Java, etc.) in a dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from untrustworthy sources. This can be a problem when a web server does not adequately ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when input is not validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented to the user.",

  "VRDA_D1_Population": "",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "The web master may change the default error page to not include the file name passed in by any user. The client may disable JavaScript (or VBScript or other scripting languages), but it doesn't address the problem of simply inserting malicious HTML, and it can cause undesired functionality."
