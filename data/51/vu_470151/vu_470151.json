  "Description": "/proc/<pid>/mem is an interface for reading and writing to process memory. The protections to protect unprivileged users from writing to process memory were found to be insufficient and have resulted in exploitation of the interface. By writing to the memory of a suid process, an attacker can run arbitrary code with root privileges. Further technical details can be found on Jason A. Donenfeld's ZX2C4 blog post.",

  "Overview": "Linux kernel >= 2.6.39 incorrectly handles the permissions for /proc/<pid>/mem. A local, authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate to root privileges. Exploit code is available in the wild and there have been reports of active exploitation.",
