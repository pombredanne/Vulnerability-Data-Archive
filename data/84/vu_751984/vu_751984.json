  "ID": "VU#751984",
  "IDNumber": "751984",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The unpack() function is not normally passed user-supplied data, and so the scope of this vulnerability is limited to specifically crafted malicious PHP scripts. However, such a script may enable an attacker to observe information on the heap. This may also enable an attacker to bypass canary-based heap runtime protection (in conjunction with VU#825816).",
  "Keywords": [
    "PHP",
    "integer overflow",
    "unpack()",
    "information disclosure"
  ],
  "Overview": "The PHP unpack() function may be exploited via unchecked input parameters, resulting in a disclosure of runtime information.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Apply an update Updates to PHP have been developed to address this issue. For more information, see: <http://www.php.net/downloads.php> PHP version 4.3.10 (4.x branch) and version 5.0.3 (5.x branch) are not susceptible to this vulnerability.",
