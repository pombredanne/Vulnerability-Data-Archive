  "Description": "According to Juniper Security Advisory #10713: During an internal code review, two security issues were identified. Administrative Access (CVE-2015-7755) allows unauthorized remote administrative access to the device. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the affected device. This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. \u00a0No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue. This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-7755 VPN Decryption (CVE-2015-7756) may allow a knowledgeable attacker who can monitor VPN traffic to decrypt that traffic. It is independent of the first issue. This issue affects ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue. There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited. This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-7756. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of these vulnerabilities,\u00a0however the password needed for the administrative access has been revealed publicly. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by these issues. For more information, please see Juniper Security Advisory #10713.",
