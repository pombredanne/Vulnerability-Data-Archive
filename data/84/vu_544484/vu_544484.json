  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Do not Enable Local User List Do not enable the local user list, and use the default authentication option instead. Disable or Restrict HTTP Access Disable the HTTP server or restrict network access to it. Note that the web interface may also be listening on port 443/tcp. If the HTTP server is not enabled, the local user list feature can safely be configured via the command line interface. See the workarounds section of Cisco security advisory cisco-sa-20060628-ap for detailed information on how to implement these workarounds."
