We take all matters of security very seriously and we are not aware of any customers who have been affected by this vulnerability. Samsung is committed to releasing updated firmware for all current models by November 30, with all other models receiving an update by the end of the year. We encourage end users to disable SNMPv1, 2 or use the secure SNMPv3 mode until the firmware updates are made."
