  "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script/HTML on the victims machine when the logs are viewed with a web browser.",
  "Keywords": [
    "AOL Instant Messenger",
    "AIM"

  "Overview": "Certain Alpha versions of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), that were leaked, would log errors to a log file. By sending a crafted image file, it may be possible to execute arbitrary script/HTML on a victims browser when they view the log files.",
  "References": "http://www.windowsitsecurity.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=19811",
  "Resolution": "Upgrade to AIM version 4.7, or any other non-leaked version, which has logging disabled.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not use pre-production alpha's, especially ones that have been leaked/stolen. Open the logs in a text-only viewer. You can also configure AIM to not accept any image connections. Additionally, AIM versions 4.4 or higher that support logging, also included a Log Manager. Use the Log Manager to view log files."
