  "Description": "Artiva Agency Single Sign-On (SSO) feature when configured with the domain name option allows the currently logged on Windows user to automatically be logged into the Artiva Agency application using the same username without any additional authentication. Artiva Agency Single Sign-On (SSO) checks only the local Window login name and as a result does not take into consideration the associated user's domain name. By creating a local Windows user account with the same username as a Windows domain account, Artiva Agency will allow the attacker to login as the domain account to the Artiva Agency application.",
