  "Description": "The xterm under consideration is a X11R5 client\ncompiled from an original distribution from MIT. (The build date on\nthe xterm is 06 Sep 1991) And the x-server is X11R4 distribution from\nIBM bundled with AIX 3.2.0.\n\nThe problem manifests itself rather randomly and is difficult to\nreproduce. This is what happens:\n\nUser A and User B are both using xterm described above.  Suppose user\nA exited xterm abnormally (say by killing the window manager), the pty\nattached to the xterm still stays hanging. Now User B starts another\nxterm. S/he could potentially get the hanging pty from user A's\nabnormally terminated xterm; thus user B now has access to user A's\naccount.\n\nThe problem was reported to IBM's Software Support group in Austin, TX.\nThey acknowledged the problem and have notified MIT in the past.  It is\nsupposedly fixed in X11R5 which is bundled with AIX 3.2.4.  IBM has made\nAIX 3.2.4 available for sometime now.",
