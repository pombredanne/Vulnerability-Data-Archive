  "Description": "nlockmgr is a service (RPC program number 100021 =\nnlockmgr) for standard \"lockd\" daemon, which all Unix servers running\nNFS have.. So the vulnerability is for \"lockd\". You can check for it\nas running on all Unix machines by simply running a command like:\n\nrpcinfo | fgrep 100021\n\nto check whether it has registered.\n\n\nThis particular enbedded program is designed for the SPARC platform\n\nFurther feedback from SNI -\n\nA problem with nlockmgr; basically nfsd in another form, except\nthat it runs on port 4045 instead of 2049.  This means that folks need\nto block this port at their router also, not just 2049.",
