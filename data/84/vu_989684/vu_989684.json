  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The Cerberus FTP Server web interface is vulnerable to CSRF using the HTTP POST method in the <targetip>:10000/usermanager/users/modify. The application has web based administration which allows authorized administrators to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the source of the requests.This can be exploited to add, delete, modify or stop the FTP service, for example to add a user.",
  "ID": "VU#989684",
  "IDNumber": "989684",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the Cerberus FTP Server web interface can conduct a cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery which could be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent  CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Cerberus FTP Server web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
