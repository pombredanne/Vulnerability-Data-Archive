  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds may partially mitigate future cross-site scripting (XSS) and XSRF vulnerabilities: Workarounds for users\nUsing Gmail's SMTP and POP or IMAP servers to send and receive mail will mitigate vulnerabilities in the Gmail web interface. The NoScript Firefox extension may mitigate XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities by restricting which sites can execute JavaScript and send cross-site POST requests. Encrypting sensitive emails and attachments will limit the impact of XSRF or other authentication bypass vulnerabilities. Workarounds for administrators\nBlacklisting known XSS or XSRF exploit URLs using proxy server or application firewall rules at the network permiter may prevent some vulnerabilities from being exploited. Note that this workaround will not stop all known XSS or XSRF attack vectors."
