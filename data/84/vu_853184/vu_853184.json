  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted Office documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call the appropriate Office application to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information for Word, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, and .dot) will not detect all Office documents. Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool. Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document."
