  "Resolution": "Per SKYPE-SB/2008-001, Skype has temporarily disabled the ability to add videos from the Dailymotion site until an official fix has been made available. Note that the Dailymotion website contained an XSS vulnerability that could be used as an attack vector, and blocking new videos from the Dailymotion website will not completely address this issue.",

  "Workarounds": "Include Skype in the Local Machine Zone Lockdown Configuring Skype to use the Local Machine Zone Lockdown may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by preventing Skype from evaluating script in the Local Machine Zone. To set Skype in the Local Machine Zone, edit the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\FeatureControl\\FEATURE_LocalMachine_Lockdown registry entry to include the DWORD value Skype.exe and set the Value data to 1. Skype must be completely quit and restarted for the changes to take effect. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\FeatureControl\\FEATURE_LocalMachine_Lockdown] \"Skype.exe\"=dword:00000001 Note that this workaround does not directly address the vulnerability. The workaround may make cause some of Skype's features to fail or to operate with limited functionality."
