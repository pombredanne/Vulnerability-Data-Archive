  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Any attacker who can reach a vulnerable web server can gain complete control of the system and execute arbitrary code in the Local System security context. Note that this may be significantly more serious than a simple \"web defacement.\"",

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Win32 API libraries shipped with all versions of Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition. This vulnerability, which is being actively exploited on WebDAV-enabled IIS 5.0 servers, will allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on unpatched systems. Sites running Microsoft Windows should apply a patch or disable WebDAV services as soon as possible.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds\nDisable vulnerable service\nUntil a patch can be applied, you may wish to disable IIS: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;321141 If you cannot disable IIS, consider using the IIS lockdown tool to disable WebDAV (removing WebDAV can be specified when running the IIS lockdown tool). Alternatively, you can disable WebDAV by following the instructions located in Microsoft's Knowledgebase Article 241520, \"How to Disable WebDAV for IIS 5.0\": http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;241520 Restrict buffer size If you cannot use the IIS lockdown tool, consider restricting the size of the buffer IIS utilizes to process requests by using Microsoft's URL Buffer Size Registry Tool. This tool can be run against a local or remote Windows 2000 system running Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3. The tool, instructions on how to use it, and instructions on how to manually make changes to the registry are available here: URL Buffer Size Registry Tool - http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14875\nMicrosoft Knowledge Base Article 816930 - http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;816930\nMicrosoft Knowledge Base Article 260694 - http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;260694 You may also wish to use URLScan, which will block web requests that attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Information about URLScan is available at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;[LN];326444"
