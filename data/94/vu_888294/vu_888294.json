  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to poison a web cache, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and bypass perimeter defenses. As a result users may be tricked into visiting a malicious web site that  is under the control of an attacker.",

  "Overview": "Inconsistencies in the way interconnected devices process HTTP request headers may allow a remote attacker to poison a cache, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and bypass perimeter defenses. These inconsistencies may allow attackers to launch a class of attacks referred to as HTTP request smuggling.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not follow unsolicited links Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. Check Certificates US-CERT recommends that prior to providing any sensitive information over a secure (HTTPS) connection, you check the name recorded in the certificate to be sure that it matches the name of the site to which you think you are connecting."
