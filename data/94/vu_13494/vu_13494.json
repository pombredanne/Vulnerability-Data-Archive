  "Description": "Sendmail is often run in daemon mode so that it can listen for incoming\nmail connections on the standard smtp networking port, usually port 25.\nThe root user is the only user allowed to start sendmail this way, and\nsendmail contains code that enforces the daemon invocation by the root\nuser mode of operation.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a coding error, sendmail versions 8.7 through\n8.8.2 can be invoked in daemon mode in such a way that the built-in\ncheck is bypassed. When bypassed, any local user is allowed to start\nsendmail in daemon mode. In addition, as of version 8.7, sendmail\nwill restart itself when it receives a SIGHUP signal. It does this\nrestarting operation by re-execing itself using the exec(2) family\nof system calls. This exec is done as the root user.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker starts a sendmail daemon\nusing a name other than sendmail, replaces the binary of the original\nsendmail daemon with a new binary that creates a root shell, and sends\nthat daemon a SIGHUP signal. This results in a root shell on the\nlocal machine.",
