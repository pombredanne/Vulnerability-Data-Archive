  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor Several vendors that implement OpenPGP have elected to reduce the exposure of this vulnerability by disabling the integrity check feature in public-key encryption modes. This is intended as a precautionary measure until the vulnerability can be fully addressed by modifying the OpenPGP standard (RFC 2440). For a discussion of this issue and the response of the OpenPGP Working Group, please read \"OpenPGP flaw prompts quick fix\". The vendor section of this document contains a list of vendors that we have contacted regarding this issue and will be updated with vendor responses as they are provided.",
