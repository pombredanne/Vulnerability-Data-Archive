  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to exploit the lock-out policy to lock valid accounts. As a result individual users or WebEOC sites may experience a complete denial-of-service. Recoving from this attack requires a WebEOC administrator to manually unlock the attacked account.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade \nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 by providing the option to not present a list of valid user names on the login page. In addition, lockout configuration for the number of failed login attempts and length of time a lockout lasts are included in the administrative functions. The site can now unlock the user\u2019s account automatically after a defined period of time as specified in the General Settings tab. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
