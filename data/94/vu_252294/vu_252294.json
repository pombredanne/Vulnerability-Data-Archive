  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Mediatrix's web management interface for the 4402 digital gateway device with firmware version Dgw 1.1.13.186, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The reflected XSS is found in the login page's vulnerable parameter \"username\". The following is a proof-of-concept of the XSS vulnerability. http://<<MediatrixWebInterfaceIP/Host>>/login.esp?r=system_info.esp&username=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the Mediatrix web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
