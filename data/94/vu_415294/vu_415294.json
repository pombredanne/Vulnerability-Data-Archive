  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in the reliance of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to maintain persistent sessions. Sustained exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition affecting a large segment of the Internet community. Normal operations would most likely resume shortly after the attack stopped.",
