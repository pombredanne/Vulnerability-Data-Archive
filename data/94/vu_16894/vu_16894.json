  "Description": "From a JANET CERT Report: \n\nVULNERABILITY IN SQUID 2.00\n\nA server running squid 2.00 with the supplied default configuration is\nvulnerable to a denial of service attack in which a client browser can\naccess a web page through the squid host which causes increased network\nbandwidth and the squid cache disk partition to eventually fill.\n\nDetails: if a client browser opens a dynamic data stream such as a\nwebcam URL via a cache host running squid 2.00 with default\nconfiguration, then closes the connection, the ongoing connection from\nthe squid host to the URL server persists and data download continues,\neventually filling the cache disk.",
