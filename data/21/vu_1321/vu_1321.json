  "Description": "The following is quoted from the origional report.\n\nThere are some problem with the packet filter code of TIS Gauntlet 4.1,\nat least in some configurations.\nI have tried to filter based on ICMP types (-proto ICMP:ECHO in one way and\n-proto ICMP:ECHOREPLY in the other way).\nIt seems that the packet filter doesn't distinguish the ICMP types, though\nthe documentation says it does.\nThe version of Gauntlet is 4.1.",
