  "ID": "VU#374121",
  "IDNumber": "374121",
  "IPProtocol": "udp\n749/tcp",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the libgssrpc library used by kadmind. kadmind will crash, thereby resulting in a denial of service. MIT notes that it is at least theoretically possible for such corruption to result in database corruption or arbitrary code execution.",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround Before starting kadmind, use \"ulimit -n\" for Bourne shell and derivatives or \"limit descriptors\" for C shell and derivatives. Or use similar resource-limiting mechanisms in the invoking process to limit the maximum open file descriptors. The chosen limit should be less than or equal to the value of the FD_SETSIZE macro typically defined in the <sys/select.h> header file."
