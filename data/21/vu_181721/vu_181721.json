  "Impact": "Anyone running NMAP on AOS 5.1.1 will see port 6778 listening. The attacker is able to telnet to the port and access the OmniSwitch operating system without a password. This backdoor compromises the entire system.",

  "Overview": "The OmniSwitch 7700/7800 running Alcatel Operating System (AOS) version 5.1.1 has TCP port 6778 listening as a telnet server. This gives anyone access to the OmniSwitch's Vx-Works operating system without requiring a password.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "1) Immediate - create an ACL blocking all access to TCP port 6778. 2) Short-term - Alcatel Customer Support has updated code that removes this backdoor. This fix is part of AOS 5.1.1.R02 and AOS 5.1.1.R03. Contact Customer Support for this updated code. 3) Permanent - the generally available AOS code--the code that ships with each OmniSwitch--will have this vulnerability removed as of AOS 5.1.3.",
