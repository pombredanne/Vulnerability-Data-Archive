  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to convince a user to click on a specially crafted URI could execute arbitrary script to \"...add, delete or modify data on the system, or take any other action of the attacker's choice.\"  An attacker could read or execute any file in a known location on a vulnerable system. Windows Me does not have a security model that manages multiple users and privileges, so any local user has complete control over the operating system.",

  "Overview": "The Help and Support Center included with Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition and XP does not adequately validate parameters provided in an \"hcp://\" URI. As a result, an attacker could construct a URI that could cause the Help and Support Center to execute arbitrary script, effectively giving the attacker full control over a vulnerable system.",
