  "Workarounds": "Prevent users from accessing the Remote Access Service For systems that do not require RAS, it may be possible to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by uninstalling or disabling the Remote Access Service. Prevent users from creating or modifying RAS phonebook entries Attackers must be able to create or modify RAS phonebook entries to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore, it may be possible to utilize access control measures such as NTFS file permissions to prevent users from exploiting this vulnerability."
