  "Description": "When vi is killed, it runs expreserve to save\nthe current file being edited.  Expreserve is setuid root and\nsaves the file to a directory owned by the calling user.\nSo it tries to remove any pre-existing file (a symbolic link)\nbefore saving so that it isn't tricked into overwriting an\nexisting file, but the check is flawed and does not work.\nEven if it did work, there would be a very small timing window\nwhere the file could be re-created just after being removed\nby expreserve.\n\nFrom a contact CIAC has who has access to Sun and Cray sources:\n\"expreserve (part of vi) was originally done at UCB.  AT&T took vi and\nincorporated it into SVR4.  The problem existed in UCB's original code\nand the same code is in the SVR4 code from AT&T.  Sun made no changes\nto this part of the code nor did Cray.  Since it all originated at UCB\nit all has the same bug.  I suspect every BSD 4.2/3, SunOS, and SVR4\nbased system has the same exact code and problem.\"",
