  "ID": "VU#115112",
  "IDNumber": "115112",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers can exploit the predictability of catman temporary filenames to overwrite arbitrary system files, regardless of ownership.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Sun",
    "Solaris",

    "tmp",
    "temporary",

  ],
  "Overview": "catman, the unix manual display utility, creates insecure temporary files with predictable names in a world-writable directory. Since catman executes with system administration privileges, a symbolic link attack could overwrite arbitrary files.",
  "References": "http://xforce.iss.net/static/5788.php",
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
