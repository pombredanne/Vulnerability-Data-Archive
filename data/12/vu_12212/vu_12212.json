  "Description": "Two widely used X Window System authorization schemes have weaknesses\nin the sample implementation.\n\nMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1:\n\nOn some systems built without the HasXdmAuth config option, the\nauthorization key used by MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 is guessable.\nThe problem is that the system rand() function, used to generate\ncookies when DES is not available, is weak on some systems.\n\nIf you use MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 to authenticate X connections, and your\nxdm does NOT also support XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentication (that is,\nxdm was built with HasXdmAuth set to NO), you may be at risk.\n\nIf your xdm program was built with HasXdmAuth set to YES (-DHASXDMAUTH\npassed on the compiler command line), your system is not vulnerable;\nthe DES code is used to generate cryptographically secure keys.\n\nXDM-AUTHORIZATION-1:\n\nThe X server does not correctly check the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 data and\ncan be fooled into accepting invalid data.\n\nA user who can snoop the encrypted authorization data of a valid\nconnection can create fake auth data that the X server will not reject\nas a replay and not reject as a fake.\n\nIf you do not use XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1, you are not vulnerable in this way.\n\n\nA review of the code has also turned up the following minor security\nweaknesses:\n\nThe X server only keeps the replay cache for XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 for\nthe same amount of time as the data is valid, so even a slight\nbackward change of the clock opens a window for replays.  Since some\nsystems do not have the adjtime() system call, setting the clock\nbackward may be necessary.\n\nMemory containing keys is not zeroed before being freed.  It may be\npossible to recover keys from core dumps, swap space, or uninitialized\nmemory.\n\nThe authority files written by xdm to pass to a local X server may\ncontain keys based on the system time.  Since the files are in a\nreadable directory, the time used to generate the key can be guessed\nin part by observing the write time of the authority file.\n\n\nFixing these problems will NOT introduce any incompatibilities.\nPatched and unpatched xdm and X server programs will interoperate.",
