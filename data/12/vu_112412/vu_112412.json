  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2014-2947\nAccording to Open-Sec consultant Mauricio Urizar, all versions of Bizagi BPM Suite contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the txtUsername POST parameter to the Login.aspx page. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2014-2948\nFurthermore, Urizar reports that all versions of Bizagi BPM Suite are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the workflowenginesoa.asmx web service. By sending specially crafted SOAP requests to the web service, a remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-2948.",
  "ID": "VU#112412",
  "IDNumber": "112412",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By exploiting the reflected XSS vulnerability, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary javascript in the context of the victim's browser. By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, a remote authenticated attacker may be able to read, modify, or delete data from the database.",
