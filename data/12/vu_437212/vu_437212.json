  "Workarounds": "Do not install ActiveX controls from untrusted web sites Although the Shockwave installer that is currently available from the macromedia.com web site does not contain the vulnerability, an attacker may choose to host the vulnerable version of the ActiveX installer. This ActiveX control may appear as valid and signed by Macromedia, Inc. Do not install ActiveX controls from untrusted web sites. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites."
