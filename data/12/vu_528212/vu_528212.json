  "Description": "According to Lomtec's website: \"Lomtec ActiveWeb offers an ideal solution for the creation, maintenance and administration of a Web site and its content.\" Lomtec ActiveWeb Professional 3.0 web content management server, running on ColdFusion, allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files. By accessing the \"getImagefile\" section of the EasyEdit module, a remote attacker could upload an executable server-side script (e.g., an .asp shell on a Microsoft Internet Information Server platform) and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web content management server.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Limit network access to hosts that require connections to the web content management server. Do not allow access to the web content management server from untrusted networks such as the internet. Filter URLs Using a reverse HTTP proxy, web server URL filtering, or similar technology, it may be possible to restrict the names and extensions of files that can be uploaded to the web content management server. Modify Web Server Permissions It may be possible to modify web content management server permissions to prevent file uploads. This may impact web content management server functionality."
