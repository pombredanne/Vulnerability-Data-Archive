  "VendorStatement": "Not vulnerable This issue does not affect the version of Apache httpd as supplied with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 The ability to exploit this issue is dependent on the stack layout for\na particular compiled version of mod_rewrite. If the compiler has\nadded padding to the stack immediately after the buffer being\noverwritten, this issue can not be exploited, and Apache httpd will\ncontinue operating normally. The Red Hat Security Response Team analyzed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3\nand Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 binaries for all architectures as\nshipped by Red Hat and determined that these versions cannot be\nexploited. We therefore do not plan on providing updates for this\nissue. For technical details see: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=200219"
