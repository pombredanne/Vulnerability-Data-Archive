  "IDNumber": "227312",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating a symbolic link with the appropriate name, an attacker may overwrite any file writable by the user running Ghostscript. This is particularly dangerous for the root account, which could lead to overwriting of system files, including the password file, and raising of the attacker's access privileges.",
  "Keywords": "mktemp mkstemp",
  "Overview": "Alladin Ghostscript, a previewer for postscript files, creates temporary files with a predictable names. The creation allows attackers to use symbolic links to overwrite other files on the host.",
