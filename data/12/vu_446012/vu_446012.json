  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted Word documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Word or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010 for more information. Consult  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-027 and Microsoft Security Advisory (919637) Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-027 and Microsoft Security Advisory (919637) list workarounds to reduce the chances of exploitation, including\nRun Word in Safe Mode (winword.exe /safe)\nDo not use Word as the email editor in Outlook\nDo not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Word to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, .dot, .rtf) may not detect all Word documents."
