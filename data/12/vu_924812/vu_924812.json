  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Nokia recommends the following: As an interim measure operators can perform the following preventative configuration changes to their networks. Ensure that all IP packets  with non standard IP options are dropped by boarder firewalls on the  Gi interface. Within the Gn network ensure that the GTP aware firewall (if present) also drops all encapsulated IP packets with non standard  IP options. This may introduce latency however it will mitigate against the attack until the patch has been fully deployed and tested."
