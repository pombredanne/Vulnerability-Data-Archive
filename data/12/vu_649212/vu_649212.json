  "Description": "A vulnerability in the way libpng handles element pointers may result in uninitialized element pointers. This vulnerability is due to an off-by-one error introduced in multiple functions in libpng-0.89c. According to the PNG Development Group: If the application runs out of memory during the loop, some of the element pointers will be uninitialized. Libpng will then longjmp to a cleanup process that attempts to free all of the elements in the array, including the uninitialized ones. This behavior could be forced by a malevolent input. Note that this issue affects all versions of libpng prior to libpng-1.0.43 and libpng-1.2.35.",
