  "Overview": "FreeBSD ships Kerberos 5 with a utility called \"k5su\" that is used to switch user IDs/cells on a timesharing system. Several vulnerabilities exist in the utility that may lead an authenticated user to gain elevated privileges.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "According to the FreeBSD Advisory: Remove the set-user-ID bit from the k5su utility: # chmod u-s /usr/bin/k5su This will completely disable k5su. Sites which wish to use Kerberos 5 authentication for SU and are comfortable with its limitations may choose to leave the set-user-ID bit enabled. As of the correction date, FreeBSD (including the\nupcoming 4.6-RELEASE) will install k5su if requested, but the set-user-ID bit will not be enabled by default. See also the ENABLE_SUID_K5SU option in make.conf(5).",
