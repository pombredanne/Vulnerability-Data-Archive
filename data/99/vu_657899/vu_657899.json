  "Overview": "Lotus Domino Servers 5.x, 4.6x, and 4.5x allow users to associate objects with documents in a database. While these objects appear to be a part of the document, they are actually stored as separate files. A vulnerability exist by which an intruder could view these objects regardless of the permissions set on the document to which they belong.",

  "Workarounds": "A workaround is to use document encryption to protect rich text fields that contain attachments. Documents can be encrypted using either public encryption keys (for example, the keys of the users listed in the reader names field) or using secret encryption keys."
