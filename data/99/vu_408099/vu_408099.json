  "Description": "The Offensive Security advisory states: By specifying an invalid field size for the encrypted username or password in a crafted RPC packet, the authentication service performs an invalid pointer dereference while trying to decrypt the character string. Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability and successful exploitation of this vulnerability for the caauthd.exe process will lead to a denial of service. Additional details may be found in CA20121018-01: Security Notice for CA ARCserve Backup.",
