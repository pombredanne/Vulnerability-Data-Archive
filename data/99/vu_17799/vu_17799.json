  "Description": "lpr can be used to overwrite or create any file on a system. Using the \"-s\" option, a user is able to create a symbolic link in lpd's spool directory. After lpr is run 1000 times it will reuse the file name that was created in the spool directory; therefore, lpr will create or overwrite any file that the link points to.",
