  "Addendum": "As noted in the MS01-020 Caveats section of the advisory, end users must apply this patch to supported versions of Microsoft's browser. This means IE must upgrade to IE 5.01 Service Pack 1 or IE 5.5 Service Pack 1 users must apply this patch. Users of IE who have not previously upgraded will receive an incorrect message stating that they do not need to apply this patch. Users are advised to upgrade to IE 5.5 SP1, IE 5.01 SP1 or SP2 (which has this patch incorporated in it). From MS01-020: Caveats: If the patch is installed on a system running a version of IE other\nthan the one it is designed for, an error message will be displayed\nsaying that the patch is not needed. This message is incorrect, and\ncustomers who see this message should upgrade to a supported version\nof IE and re-install the patches.",
