  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Explorer that allows a malicious agent to execute arbitrary code when parsing MIME parts in a document. Any user or program that uses vulnerable versions of Internet Explorer to render HTML in a document (for example, when browsing a filesystem, reading email or news messages, or visiting a web page), should immediately upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.",

  "Workarounds": "It has been reported that upgrading to the latest version of Windows Media Player is an additional means to protect yourself from this problem. Although this appears to protect you from a specific way to exploit this vulnerability, we do not believe it is a general purpose fix. Disabling File Downloading in all of your Security Zones will also mitigate against the risks posed by the vulnerability."
