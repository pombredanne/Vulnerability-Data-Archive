  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An intruder may be able to execute code with the privileges of the rwall daemon, typically root.",
  "Keywords": [

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "If no patches are available, disable the rwall daemon. If this is not an option, implement a firewall to limit access to rpc.rwalld (typically port 32777/UDP) as well as the rpc port mapper (typically port 111/TCP/UDP). Note that this will not mitigate all vectors of attack."
