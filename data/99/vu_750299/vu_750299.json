  "ID": "VU#750299",
  "IDNumber": "750299",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system.",

    "long request"
  ],
  "Overview": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). A maliciously crafted HTTP request made to the PL/SQL module could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict Access Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to the Apache service. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Disable Vulnerable Service Disable the vulnerable service (modplsql or mod_plsql in Apache)."
