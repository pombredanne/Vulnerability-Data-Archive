  "Description": "This package (running setuid root) will accept a configuration file\nparameter.  When the user supplies configuration file that they\nwould not normally have access to (such as the shadow password\nfile) the user is able to read the first line of that file since no\nchecking seems to be done to ensure that the user would otherwise\nhave read access to that file.  Preferably, of course, the package\nshould only read configuration files that the user would normally\nhave been able to read.",
