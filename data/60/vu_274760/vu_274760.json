  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Restricitng public access to vulnerable systems or blocking IPv6 packets with Type 0 Routing headers by implementing management VLANs or Access Control Lists may mitigate this vulnerability. Note that networks not using mobile IPv6 can filter all packets that contain Routing headers. Disable Services Disabling IPv6 functionality on devices using IPv4 may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. For more information about these and other workarounds, see the workarounds section of Cisco Security Advisory 20070124 and Cisco PSIRT Document 81722."
