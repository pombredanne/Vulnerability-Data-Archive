  "Overview": "WU-FTPD contains a format string vulnerability that manifests when WU-FTPD is configured to use RFC 931 authentication and is run in debug mode. A crafted identd response could be used to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.",

  "Resolution": "Apply Patch\nApply the appropriate patch supplied by your vendor. Alternatively, apply the patch provided by WU-FTPD: <dd> <dl> ftp://ftp.wu-ftpd.org/pub/wu-ftpd/patches/apply_to_current/missing_format_strings.patch\n</dl>\n</dd>",

  "Workarounds": "Disable RFC 931 Authentication\nDo not run WU-FTPD configured with '--enable-RFC931'. Disable Debug Mode\nDo not run WU-FTPD with the '-d' option. Block or Restrict Access\nBlock or restrict access to the port used by WU-FTPD, typically 21/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to WU-FTPD. Note that potential exploit strings would be transmitted from 113/tcp on clients to the WU-FTPD server that requested RFC 931 authentication. Disable Vulnerable Service\nDisable WU-FTPD until a patch can be applied."
