  "Impact": "Anyone with the private portions of the certificates can sign code such that it appears to have originated from Microsoft Corporation. If the user approves the execution of code signed by one of the bogus certificates, it can take any action on the system with the privileges of the user who approved the execution. The fake certificates can only be used for Authenticode signing.",

  "Overview": "On January 29 and 30, 2001, VeriSign, Inc. issued two certificates to an individual fraudulently claiming to be an employee of Microsoft Corporation. Any code signed by these certificates will appear to be legitimately signed by Microsoft when, in fact, it is not. Although users who try to run code signed with these certificates will generally be presented with a warning dialog, there will not be any obvious reason to believe that the certificate is not authentic.",

  "Workarounds": "Check \"Microsoft Corporation\" Certificates You can identify the fake certificates by checking the validity dates and serial numbers of the certificates. When prompted to authorize the execution of code signed by \"Microsoft Corporation\", press the \"More Info\" button to obtain additional information about the certificate used to sign the code. The fake certificates have the following description: Issued to: Microsoft Corporation\nIssued by: VeriSign Commercial Software Publishers CA\nValid from 1/29/2001 to 1/30/2002\nSerial number is 1B51 90F7 3724 399C 9254 CD42 4637 996A Issued to: Microsoft Corporation\nIssued by: VeriSign Commercial Software Publishers CA\nValid from 1/30/2001 to 1/31/2002\nSerial number is 750E 40FF 97F0 47ED F556 C708 4EB1 ABFD No legitimate certificates were issued to Microsoft between January 29 and 30, 2001. Certificates with these initial validity dates or serial numbers should not be authorized to execute code.
