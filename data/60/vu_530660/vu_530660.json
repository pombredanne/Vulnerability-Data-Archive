  "Impact": "A victim user's mailbox may be exposed to another user of the system who has successfully authenticated. The authenticated user would then be able to take any action that the victim user would be authorized to take including reading, sending, and deleting e-mail messages in the victim user's mailbox . According to Microsoft, an attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability has no guarantee it will succeed.

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-002 also describes the following workarounds for this vulnerability: 1. Disable HTTP connection reuse on an Exchange Server 2003 front-end server. By default, Exchange Server 2003 reuses HTTP Connections between front-end and back-end servers to gain improved performance. Connection reuse can be turned off on the Exchange front-end server. Doing so could cause some performance degradation, but it is an effective workaround to this vulnerability. After you apply the update to the Exchange Server 2003 front-end server, you can remove this workaround. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832749 for information about how to disable HTTP connection reuse on a Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 front-end server. Impact of workaround: Clients may experience small performance degradation when they use OWA to access their mailboxes. 2. Enable Kerberos on the virtual server that hosts OWA on the Exchange Server 2003 back-end server. The only known way that this vulnerability can be exposed is if Kerberos is disabled on the Internet Information Services virtual server where Outlook Web Access is hosted on the back-end server. This configuration change may occur when Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 2.0 is installed on the same virtual server. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832769 for information about how to configure Windows SharePoint Services to use Kerberos authentication. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 823265 for information about how to re-enable OWA and other Exchange components after you install Windows SharePoint Services. Impact of workaround: None Sites, particularly those that are unable to apply the patches above, are encouraged to consider implementing these workarounds."
