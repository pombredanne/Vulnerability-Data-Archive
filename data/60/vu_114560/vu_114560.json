  "Description": "IntelliCom NetBiter products based on the NB100 and NB200 platforms contain multiple vulnerabilities. A user who has been authenticated at the superadmin level (highest authentication level) has permission to read system files by calling read.cgi with options to read a system file. Local configuration files may be accessed by exploiting a directory traversal vulnerability. This may lead an attacker to research other potential attack vectors. An attacker may also execute arbitrary commands by uploading malicious code. For additional information see ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-10-316-01A.",
