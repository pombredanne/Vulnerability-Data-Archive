  "Description": "CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, and CWE-284: Improper Access Control - CVE-2015-0929\nBy visiting time.htm, a user is issued a cookie that grants administrative privileges in the Servision HVG web interface. There are two distinct impacts of this vulnerability: An unauthenticated user is able to bypass authentication. This is addressed in firmware version 2.2.26a78 and later. An authenticated user is able to elevate privileges. This is reportedly not addressed as of the current release, version 2.2.26a100. CWE-259: Use of Hard-Coded Password - CVE-2015-0930 SerVision HVG contains a hardcoded password that enables a user to log into the web interface with administrative rights. This is addressed in firmware version 2.2.26a100.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Appropriate firewall rules which block incoming connections from untrusted networks would likely prevent an external attacker from accessing the device. Note that this does not address the issue of trusted, authenticated users accessing time.htm and gaining elevated privileges."
