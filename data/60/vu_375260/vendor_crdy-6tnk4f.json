Software updates for the Apache-based Web Server are available from: http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/\ndisplayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 and HP-UX B.11.23 require the Apache-based Web Server \nv.2.0.58.00 or subsequent. Apache Update Procedure Check for Apache Installation To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your system, \nuse Software Distributor's swlist command. All three revisions of the product \nmay co-exist on a single system. For example, the results of the command\nswlist -l product | grep -i apache\nhpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.55.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server Stop Apache Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary. Otherwise, \nthe previous binary will continue running, preventing the new one from starting,\nalthough the installation would be successful. After determining which Apache is \ninstalled, stop Apache with the following commands: for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop Download and Install Apache Download Apache from Software Depot: http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/\ndisplayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value \nspecified on the installation web page. Use SD to swinstall the depot. Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing HP Apache \ninstallation is supported, while installation over a non-HP Apache is NOT supported. Removing Apache Installation If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of installing a newer revision \nto resolve the security problem, use both Software Distributor's \"swremove\" command \nand also \"rm -rf\" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file \"HOME\" variables. %ls /etc/rc.config.d | \\ grep apache hpapache2conf hpws_apache[32]conf MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions\nInstall the revision of the product.
