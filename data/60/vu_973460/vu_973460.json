  "Description": "drchrono provides an EHR web application service at drchrono.com, onpatient.com, and possibly other domains. The application contains XSS (CWE-80) and CSRF (CWE-352) vulnerabilities: CSRF in new user feature allows a user to be created\nCSRF protection bypass in new user feature allows CSRF, also allows an administrator to be created, requires attacker to be able to manipulate DNS or HTTP traffic\nXSS in email feature sends email to patients\nXSS in media upload feature allows attacker to read all data\nXSS in email parsing allows authenticated user (including patients) to create a malicious email message to be read by a victim\nXSS in patient document upload feature allows attacker to read all data To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to 1.) be (or act as) an authenticated user to upload or send malicious content or 2.) entice an authenticated user (most likely a clinician) to access the attacker's uploaded content or a web page hosted by the attacker.",
