  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2015-6004 The \"Find Device\" search field does not properly neutralize user input, allowing an unauthenticated (e.g., the guest account) attacker to perform SQL queries and commands by inserting ticks or percent characters. The \"UniqueID\" parameter does not sufficiently sanitize user-provided input, leading to a complete compromise of the database associated with the WhatsUpGold application. This parameter is only accessible post-authentication. For more information, please see Rapid7's advisory R7-2015-19. CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - CVE-2015-6005 A stored XSS vulnerability can be triggered by poisoning certain SNMP OID objects and waiting for a WhatsUpGold instance to query the SNMP endpoint. SNMP trap messages may also be used. For more information, please see Rapid7's advisory R7-2015-19. Furthermore, the following user input fields do not properly neutralize user input, allowing an attacker to perform stored XSS attacks: View Names\nGroup Names\nFlow Monitor Credentials and Threshold Name\nTask Library Name and Description\nPolicy Library Name and Description\nTemplate Library Name and Description\nSystem Script Library Name and Description\nCLI Settings Library Description These fields appear to be only accessible by privileged accounts (e.g., administrator accounts) and therefore are unlikely to be exploited in practice. According to the reporters, WhatsUp Gold version 16.3 is affected by these vulnerabilities. Other versions may also be affected. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-6004.",
