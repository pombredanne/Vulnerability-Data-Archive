  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. Public reports indicate that this vulnerability is used by malicious code called Bofra (also identified as variants of W32/MyDoom).",

  "Workarounds": "Install Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) Microsoft Windows XP SP2 is not affected by this vulnerability. Disable Active scripting Disabling Active scripting makes it somwehat more difficult for an attacker to prepare the heap to easily execute arbitrary code. At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, or any other software that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that an attacker may be able to prepare the heap using other techinques, in which case disabling Active scripting would only provides defense against attacks that use Active scripting. Do not follow unsolicited links Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Use current versions of Outlook or Outlook Express By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 use the Restricted Sites Zone to display HTML messages. Because IFRAME and FRAME elements are not rendered in the Restricted Sites Zone, these email clients do not act as attack vectors by default. Render email in plain text Configure email client software (mail user agent [MUA]) to render email messages in plain text. Instructions to configure Outlook 2002, Outlook 2003, and Outlook Express 6 are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles 307594, 831607, and 291387, respectively. Maintain updated antivirus software Antivirus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on antivirus software to defend against this vulnerability."
