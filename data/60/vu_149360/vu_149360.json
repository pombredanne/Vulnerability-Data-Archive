  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) implementation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive system information or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
  "References": "http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-029.mspx",
  "Resolution": "Apply Patch Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin  MS04-029. Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via Windows Update. Restrict Access You may wish to block access to from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to: TCP ports 135, 139, 445, 593, \nUDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, \nAll other unsolicited inbound connections. You may also wish to disable Com Internet Services and RPC over HTTP. This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate.",
