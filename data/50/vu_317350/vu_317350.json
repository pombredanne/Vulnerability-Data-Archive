  "Impact": "A remote attacker with the ability to send a crafted packet to the DHCPD listening port (typically port 67/UDP), may be able to crash the ISC DHCP daemon, causing a denial of service. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server with the privileges of the DHCPD process (typically root).",
  "Keywords": [
    "ISC DHCPD",
    "buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Internet Systems Consortium's (ISC) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 3 application contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial of service condition to the DHCP Daemon (DHCPD) and may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the DHCPD process.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "ISC has released DHCP 3.0.1rc14 which resolves this issue. Versions prior to ISC DHCP 3 are no longer supported. All users of ISC DHCP are encouraged to update to the latest version.",
