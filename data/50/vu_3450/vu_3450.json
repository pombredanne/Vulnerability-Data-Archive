  "Description": "libc uses the file specified by RESOLV_HOST_CONF instead of\n/etc/resolv.conf. The problem lies in programs which are setuid (usually\nsetuid to root... such as ping, traceroute, etc.). This bug is fixed in\nlibc-5.4.x. However, that version of the library is generally considered\nto be too buggy for \"production\" use. There *may* be patches to\nlibc-5.2.18, but I haven't been able to find them.\n\nThe solution? The latest NetKit has \"temporary\" fixes (they clean out\nthe environment). That covers a lot of the programs (ping, rsh, etc.).\nHowever, that leaves programs such as traceroute (and others such as\nssh, which you don't have). For those, you can create a program that\ncleans out the environment and then call the real program.",

(I suggest making that program setgid something, and chmodding 4710 the\noriginal program.) Alternatively, chmodding 700 would work as well (but\nmay be inconvenient for some users)."
