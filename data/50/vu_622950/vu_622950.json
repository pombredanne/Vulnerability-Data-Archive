  "Resolution": "Use \"Enhanced Security\"\n4690 OS version V5R1 or later has the option to enable \"Enhanced Security\" that will use the SHA1 hashing algorithm. Instructions for enabling 4690 OS Enhanced Security can be found in the V6R4 4690 OS Planning, Installation, and Configuration Guide beginning on page 140. Use a LDAP server for authentication\n4690 OS version V6R3 or later has the option to use an LDAP server for authentication. This method will use whatever hashing algorithm the LDAP server uses.
