  "ID": "VU#403150",
  "IDNumber": "403150",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Microsoft Windows may incorrectly determine the appropriate application to handle a protocol. For example, a \"safe\" protocol such as [<font face=\"courier\">mailto:</font>] may be incorrectly handled with an \"unsafe\" application, such as the Windows command interpreter. This can allow unexpected execution of arbitrary commands.",

    "Internet Explorer arbitrary command execution",

  ],
  "Overview": "Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle protocols specified in a URI, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.",
