  "Workarounds": "Disable Outlook Web Access Until a patch can be applied, you may wish to disable Outlook Web Access for each affected Exchange site. You can do this by performing the following steps: Start Exchange Administrator. Expand the Configuration container for the site. Click the Protocols container for the site. Open the properties of the HTTP (Web) Site Settings object. Click to clear the Enable Protocol check box. Wait for the change to replicate, and then verify that this change has replicated to each server in the site. To do this, bind to each server in the site with Exchange Administrator, and then view the setting."
