  "ID": "VU#262350",
  "IDNumber": "262350",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker could convince a user that they were viewing a native Mozilla dialog, when in fact they are visiting a page created by the attacker. The attacker could use additional social engineering techniques to trick the victim into disclosing sensitive information such as credit card numbers, account numbers, and passwords. The attacker could also spoof pop-up windows that do not display the address bar.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Mozilla",
    "JavaScript",

  "Overview": "Mozilla allows websites to disable various browser status elements. This allows websites to create spoofed dialogs using XUL.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the ability to hide status items By performing the following steps, it is possible to prevent JavaScript from disabling status elements. This will make XUL-created pages appear distinct from native Mozilla dialogs. 1. Enter \"about:config\" in Mozilla's address bar. This will display Mozilla's configuration values. 2. Set the following values to true: dom.disable_window_open_feature.titlebar\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.close\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.toolbar\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.location\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.directories\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.personalbar\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.menubar\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.scrollbars\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.minimizable\ndom.disable_window_open_feature.status These preferences can also be set via the user.js file."
