  "Description": "SCO has discovered a bug in its Lan Manager product that may result\nin unaothorized access to the system including unauthorized root access.\nThe seriousness of this bug is made clear by the fact that the intruder\nneed not have previous \"authorized\" access to the system.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that when installing Lan Manager (LMU),\na user called lmxadmin is created, but without a password. This allows\n*anyone* to login as lmxadmin and tinker with the configuration of the\nserver. A clever intruder could the set things up to allow a client\nLan Manager machine unauthorized root access to files on the Unix\nserver. SCO will soon be providing a Maintenance Supplement for\nLan Manager that will check for and plug this hole.",
