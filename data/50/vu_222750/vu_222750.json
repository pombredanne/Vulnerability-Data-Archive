  "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause TCP connections to drop or be degraded using spoofed ICMP error messages. Applications that depend on on long-lived, low latency, or high throughput TCP connections may not function correctly on a degraded TCP connection. In order to spoof an ICMP message, an attacker would need to know or guess the source and destination TCP port and IP address four-tuple. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is of paticular concern since it relies on long-lived TCP connections (VU#415294), uses well-known source and destination ports, provides critical network and Internet routing information, and may require a non-trivial period of time to recover from a sustained attack.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch\nUpgrade or apply a patch according to vendor instructions. Note that changes made by upgrades or patches may not completely defend against spoofed ICMP attacks. Consult vendor documentation for information on changes to ICMP message handling. Consider the general and attack-specific countermeasures discussed in the Gont I-D. Some of the countermesures include validating TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers contained in ICMP messages, improving TCP ephemeral port number randomization, changing the response to or ignoring certain ICMP messages, and delaying connection resets. Note that different countermeasures have different constraints and may negatively impact TCP operations. Filter ICMP messages Filter ICMP messages based on type and code at network borders. Allow only ICMP messages that are necessary for proper operation. IPsec and TCP MD5 Note that TCP MD5 does not provide authentication for ICMP messages. Current IPsec specifications do not define how IPsec implementations should handle ICMP messages destined for authenticated TCP connections.",

  "ThanksAndCredit": "Information about the security risks of ICMP messages has been known for some time (RFC 1191 was published in 1990). More recent work by Fernando Gont (Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Nacional - Facultad Regional Haedo) describes different types of ICMP attacks against TCP and proposes a number of defense techniques. Gont's research is documented in an IETF Internet Draft titled \"ICMP attacks against TCP\" (revision 3 as of this writing). Jonathan Looney researched and reported a specific ICMP attack that affects TCP connections on Microsoft Windows systems.",
