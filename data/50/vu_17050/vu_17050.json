  "Description": "VMS authorize program has an internal protection mask that\noverrides default protections every time a list is created (sysuaf.lis,\nrightslist.lis and netproxy.lis).  What I have found is that the default\nprotection placed in these files is (S:RWE,O:RWE,G:RW,W), irregardless of any\nACLs, directory defaults, previous file version values or account defaults.",
  "ID": "VU#17050",
  "IDNumber": "17050",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "While it is self evident that a non-priv user would not benefit from\nthis vulnerability since the files are both owned by SYSTEM and\nlocated in SYS$SYSTEM (SYSTEM's group is still SYSTEM), the\nvulnerability really manifests itself when a \"knowledgable\" user runs\nauthorize and creates their own whatever.DAT and whatever.LIS files in\ntheir personal directory. (For example, a system manager in training\nwho's group/UIC does not automatically entitle them to SYSTEM\nprotection would be vulnerable.)",
