  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable isakmpd\nUsers are encouraged to disable the isakmpd on systems that do not require them to be running. Filter network traffic to the ISAKMP daemon\nPermit network traffic to the ISAKMP daemon (500/udp) from only trusted hosts. This will not mitigate attacks from within the firewall perimeter, but may mitigate attacks from outside your network. As a matter of good security practice, users who have applied the patches for this vulnerability may also wish to consider implementing this step to mitigate against other unknown relevant vulnerabilities."
