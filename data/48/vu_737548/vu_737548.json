  "Workarounds": "Edit configuration file According to the Sun Security Advisory, the following workaround could be used to mitigate against this vulnerability: For sites which are utilizing both IPv4 and IPv6 (see inet(3SOCKET)) network interfaces, to prevent this issue from occurring the sshd_config(4) file can be edited to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 configured interfaces by setting the \"ListenAddress\" keyword to contain two colons (::). For example: $ grep ^ListenAddress /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nListenAddress :: If the sshd_config(4) file is modified, the sshd daemon needs to be sent a SIGHUP signal to re-read the file. For example, as the root user: # pkill -HUP sshd"
