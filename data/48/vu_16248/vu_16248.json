  "Description": "ipxchk has to be run with -check option, otherwise it segfaults (a\nstrings gives this info). Wen run, ipxchk happily forks a sh, which in\nturn performs a couple of things, among them, an rm command. The sh\ninherits the uid=0 from ipxchk, and ipxchk doesn't bother resetting the\nPATH. The exploit is then straightforward.",
