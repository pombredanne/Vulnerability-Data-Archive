  "Description": "Embarcadero Delphi and C++ Builder tools contain a buffer overflow (CWE-119) in VCL BMP file processing code (Vcl.Graphics.TPicture.Bitmap). Core Security Technologies advisory CORE-2014-0004 provides further details, including more specific information about vulnerable development tools. Any application built with a vulnerable VCL version are likely to also be vulnerable.",
  "ID": "VU#646748",
  "IDNumber": "646748",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker who can cause a vulnerable application to process a specially crafted BMP file could execute arbitrary code. Whether or not the attacker is remote or authenticated depends on the interfaces and behavior of the vulnerable application.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "Embarcadero Delphi and C++ Builder Visual Component Library (VCL) bitmap (BMP) file processing code contains a buffer overflow that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
