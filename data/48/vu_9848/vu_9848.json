  "Description": "Linux provides a very useful and powerfull proc-filesystem.\nThis filesystem provides a file with an image of the physical\nmemory ( /proc/kcore ). In contrast to /dev/kmem, which is a character\ndevice, /proc/kcore appears as a regular file.",
  "ID": "VU#9848",
  "IDNumber": "9848",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If the complete file tree is dumped ( tar c / ) , the proc filesystem\nis dumped also if mounted. Archiving programs like tar can't\ndistinguish between regular files and the files in /proc and write\nthe memory image to the archiv. All data which reside in the RAM at this time are dumped with\n/proc/kcore. If there are passwords etc. (e.g. someone using pgp at\ndump time) in the RAM, these can be found later in the tape archive.",
