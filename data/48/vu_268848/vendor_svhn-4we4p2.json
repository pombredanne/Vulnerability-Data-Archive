ISSUE:     Text editors contain a buffer overflow. PLATFORM:  HP9000 Series 700 and 800 running HP-UX releases 11.00,\n           11.04, 10.20, 10.24, 10.10, and 10.01. POSSIBLE RESULT: Users could compromise system availability. SOLUTION: Apply patches for HP-UX releases as follows: for 11.00:           PHCO_22229,\n                     11.04:           PHCO_23354,\n                     10.20:           PHCO_22228,\n                     10.24:           PHCO_23353,\n                     10.10:           PHCO_22848,\n                     10.01:           PHCO_22849. AVAILABILITY: The patches are available now. I. A. Background\n       Hewlett-Packard Company has become aware of a defect in the\n       text editor, in various releases of the HP-UX OS. This defect\n       affects various programs such as e, ex, vi, edit, view, and\n       vedit which all use the same facilities. B. Fixing the problem\n       The problem can be fully resolved by applying the appropriate\n       patches to the system. For HP-UX releases\n                 for 11.00:           PHCO_22229,\n                     11.04:           PHCO_23354,\n                     10.20:           PHCO_22228,\n                     10.24:           PHCO_23353,\n                     10.10:           PHCO_22848,\n                     10.01:           PHCO_22849. While this patch does not require a reboot, appropriately\n       terminating any instances of editor before installation of the\n       patch will assure that continued operation is now done with\n       the patched binaries.
