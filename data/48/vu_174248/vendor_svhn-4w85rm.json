This defect is documented as\nCisco bug ID CSCdt32570. This advisory is available at\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/arrowpoint-useraccnt-debug-pub.shtml. Affected Products The CSS switch is also known as the Arrowpoint product, and runs the Cisco\nWebNS Software. Cisco CSS 11050, CSS 11150, and CSS 11800 hardware platforms are affected\nby this vulnerability. No other Cisco products are affected by this\nvulnerability. If the switch is running a version prior to 4.01B19s, then it is affected\nand should be upgraded as soon as possible. You may type version at the\ncommand line to find out software version number. Details A non-privileged user can issue a series of keystrokes to enter the debug\nmode, and from that mode can gain administrative access.

If access to the command line\ninterface is well protected and restricted, these vulnerabilities are\nminimized. Cisco Bug ID CSCdt32570 describes this vulnerability. Software Versions and Fixes CSCdt32570 is resolved in version 4.01B19s of Cisco WebNS software. Non-privileged users can no longer enter debug mode.
