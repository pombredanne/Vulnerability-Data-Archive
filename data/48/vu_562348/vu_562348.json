  "IDNumber": "562348",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Malicious users can post content to MediaWiki collaborative environments and include active script code. For many users the active script code will be executed by their browsers, due to active content being enabled by default in many popular browsers.",
  "Keywords": [
    "MediaWiki",
    "cross-site scripting",
    "css",
    "HTML attributes"
  ],
  "Overview": "Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki.",

  "Resolution": "Update to version 1.3.13 or 1.4.5. For more information see the release notes available at: http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=332231 The release notes indicate that: Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to\n     inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to\n     cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki. We have not validated that the fix protects against inclusion of other active content, such as \"applet://\", \"about://\", \"activex://\", \"chrome://\", and \"script://\"",

  "Workarounds": "As a best practice, users of bulletin board sites and other sites where content is created from untrusted sources, such as the public, should consider turning off all forms of scripting support in their browsers. More information about injecting code into forums is available in the CERT/CC advisory CA-2000-02."
