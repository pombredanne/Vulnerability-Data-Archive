  "Impact": "An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox. Depending on the system, the attacker could listen to and delete messages, change the greeting message, or make other modifications. By changing the greeting message, an attacker may be able to charge calls to an account with a vulnerable voice mail system: <http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58517,00.html> Any system that relies solely on caller ID for authentication may be vulnerable to impersonation or spoofing attacks.",

  "Overview": "Certain voice mail systems trust Calling Number Identification (CNID, Caller ID) to authenticate administrative access to voice mail accounts. Caller ID can be easily spoofed, allowing an attacker to gain control over a vulnerable voice mailbox.",
