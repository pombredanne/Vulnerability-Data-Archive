  "Description": "CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type The D-Link DCS-93xL family of devices allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files from the attackers system. The attacker may specify the file location to write on the device. This could lead to data being created, modified, or deleted. It may also lead to arbitrary code execution. The D-Link Firmware Version 1.04 (2014-04-21) has been found to be vulnerable. Other firmware versions may also be affected. This firmware is used on the DCS-931L, DCS-930L, DCS-932L, and DCS-933L models.",
