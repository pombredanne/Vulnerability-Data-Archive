  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Restrict access to the SSH server on the VPN concentrator by applying appropriate rules to the filters for the interfaces such that connections are permitted only from trusted client hosts. Sites may additionally wish to filter SSH connections on network devices that are upstream from the affected VPN Concentrator device. Sites may wish to apply this workaround in conjunction with the application of the recommended patches. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends that sites block all types of network traffic that are not explicitly required for normal operation."
