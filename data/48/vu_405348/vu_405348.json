  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable uploads in the ProFTP daemon. Since exploitation of the vulnerability requires an attacker to place a specially crafted file on the vulnerable system, disabling uploads will prevent them from being able to do this via FTP. Note that this step will not prevent exploitation if the attacker is able to upload the file into the FTP area via some other means, such as ssh or a web form."
