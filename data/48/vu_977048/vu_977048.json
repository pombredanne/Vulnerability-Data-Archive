  "Description": "The TEMA Remote Installer contains an ActiveX control that exposes a method that allows execution of arbitrary code. If a specially crafted MSI file renamed \u201cThinClient_TemaKit.msi\u201d is downloaded using Honeywell\u2019s TEMA Remote Installer, the file will be silently installed on the target machine. This specially crafted MSI file could then alter the functionality and control of the running EBI system and enable other unauthorized remote actions. The implementation of this ActiveX control does not verify the origin of the MSI file, allowing an attacker to craft an MSI file that can be downloaded and silently installed on the target machine. For additional information please see ICSA- 11-285-01.",
