  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to convince a user to access a specially crafted HTML document, such as an Internet web page or HTML email message, could execute arbitrary script with privileges of the user in the security context of the Local Machine Zone. This technique could be used to read certain types of files in known locations on the user's system. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities (VU#626395, VU#25249), the attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system. The attacker could also determine the path to the Temporary Internet Files folder (cache) and access data from other web sites.",

  "Overview": "A cross-domain scripting vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) evaluates Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers and checks for files in the local browser cache. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary script in a different domain, including the Local Machine Zone.",
