  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access You may wish to block access to from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to TCP ports 135, 139, 445, 593 and UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445. You maye also wish to disable Com Internet Services and RPC over HTTP. This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. Disable DCOM Depending on site requirements, you may wish to disable DCOM as described in MS03-026. Disabling DCOM will help protect against this vulnerability, but may also cause undesirable side effects. Additional details on disabling DCOM and possible side effects are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825750."
