  "Workarounds": "Workarounds\nUntil updates can be applied, the following workarounds may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability: Do not decompress gzip files that are received from unknown sources. Do not execute gzip with system-level privileges. Some automated processes may rely on gzip to complete their tasks. When possible, disable such programs or do not allow them to execute gzip with root privileges."
