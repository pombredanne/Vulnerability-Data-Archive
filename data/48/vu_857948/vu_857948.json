  "Description": "CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication - CVE-2015-2847 The Honeywell Tuxedo Touch Controller web interface uses JavaScript to check for client authentication and redirect unauthorized users to a login page. By intercepting and dropping requests containing the string USERACCT=USERNAME:_,PASSWORD:_, an unauthenticated user may bypass authentication and access restricted pages. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-2848 Honeywell Tuxedo Touch Controller contains a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. Note that these actions may include issuing commands to home automation devices controlled by the Tuxedo Touch Controller, such as unlocking or locking doors. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2015-2848.",
  "ID": "VU#857948",
  "IDNumber": "857948",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to bypass authentication checks to view restricted pages, or trick an authenticated user into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. Compromised Tuxedo Touch Controllers may be leveraged to operate home automation devices, such as unlocking or locking doors.",
