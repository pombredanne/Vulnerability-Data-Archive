  "Description": "Qolsys IQ Panel is an Android OS-based touch screen controller for home automation devices and functions. All firmware versions contain the following vulnerabilities. CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - CVE-2015-6032 Qolsys IQ Panel contains multiple hard-coded cryptographic keys. With these keys it may be possible for attackers to sign malicious code that would then be accepted as valid by affected devices. CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature - CVE-2015-6033 Qolsys IP Panel fails to properly validate cryptographic signatures for software updates before installing them. Malicious updates provided by an attacker may be accepted as valid by affected devices. CWE-937: OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities Qolsys IP Panel uses an outdated version of Android OS with known vulnerabilities. An attacker may be able to leverage vulnerabilities affecting Android 2.2.1 to compromise affected devices. The CVSS score below is for CVE-2015-6033.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 3,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Since the nature of these vulnerabilities means that malicious updates can be made to appear valid, users should consider disabling automatic updates altogether. Users should confirm the source of any update before applying it manually."
