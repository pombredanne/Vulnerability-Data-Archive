  "Description": "When a client (browser, applet and so on) downloads a Java applet,\nthe applet does NOT determine which IP address it retrieved the\ninitial applet from using the physical TCP/IP connection\ninformation.  Rather it appears that it does a DNS lookup to\ndetermine this after the applet gets downloaded.\n\nThis means an applet may initially come from teh correct (intended\nhost).  When the downloaded applet tries to make a secondary\nconnection (back to its originating host), its possible to fool the\napplet into making a connection to some other host by poisoning the\nDNS cache, thus making the DNS lie about its IP address and point\nto another internal or external IP address.\n\nThis can be leveraged by an attacker to bypass firewall filters by\nan attacker.  By crafting an appropriate applet, watching for sites\nthat download the applet and then poisoning the DNS cache used at\nthe victim site, it is possible to make the applet make arbitrary\nconnections within the victim site's network.",
