  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to download and run a malicious Java applet, an intruder could read, write, and modify files on the system with privileges of the victim. The reporter notes that some private Java packages contain classes that allow direct access to memory or provide methods that can modify private fields of Java objects. This could allow an intruder to disable the Java security manager.",
