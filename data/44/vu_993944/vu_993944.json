  "Description": "1. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: An attacker may use a malformed URL address in a XSS attack to launch JavaScript code. 2. SQL INJECTION: An attacker can use a malformed URL address to execute an SQL injection attack. 3. CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY: The web application does not sufficiently verify whether a request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. 4. INFORMATION LEAKAGE: An unauthenticated user can access restricted information using specific URL addresses. 5. UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION: This vulnerability can be exploited by using specifically crafted URL addresses, which allows an unauthenticated user to enable or disable date and time syncing. 6. STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in opcImg.asp that, when exploited, allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. 7. AUTHENTICATION VULNERABILITY: An authentication vulnerability exists in uaddUpAdmin.asp in Advantech\u2019s WebAccess 7.0\u2014and possibly earlier versions\u2014that, when exploited, allows an attacker to remotely change an administrator\u2019s password. Exploit code is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 8. AUTHENTICATION VULNERABILITY: An authentication vulnerability exists in GbScriptAddUp.asp that, when exploited, allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. 9. ACTIVEX BUFFER OVERFLOW: A long string input to ActiveX parameters will cause a buffer overflow, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the server. 10.BUFFER OVERFLOW: This vulnerability exists because long string input to parameters will cause a buffer overflow, which could allow execution of arbitrary code. 11.FILE MANIPULATION: An attacker can load any remote web page and write to a local batch file that will allow arbitrary code execution. 12.SQL INJECTION: This vulnerability exists because string inputs are not checked, allowing attackers to perform SQL injection attacks. 13.CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: This vulnerability exists because malicious cross-site scripts are allowed by parameters of bwerrdn.asp. 14.CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: This vulnerability exists because malicious cross-site scripts are allowed by parameters of bwview.asp. 15.ARBITRARY MEMORY CORRUPTION: This vulnerability exists because functions are allowed to corrupt arbitrary memory zones through fully controllable stream identifiers. 16.FORMAT STRING: A format string vulnerability can be exploited by the using a message string without the required format arguments. 17.ACTIVEX BUFFER OVERFLOW: A component used by WebAccess, bwocxrun.ocx, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to methods that are capable of creating a arbitrary file in arbitrary location. Exploitation could allow the execution of arbitrary code. 18.SQL INJECTION: This vulnerability exists because string inputs are not checked on input, allowing attackers to perform many different SQL injection attacks.
