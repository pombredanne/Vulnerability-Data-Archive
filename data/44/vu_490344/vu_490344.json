  "Impact": "An attacker with physical access to your wire may be able to gain unauthenticated TFTP access, allowing them to perform the following operations: inspection of configuration data\nrecovery and setting of passwords\ninspection and updates to the firmware\ndestructive updates to the firmware\nmalicious custom updates to the firmware Note that affected Alcatel ADSL modems do not provide any mechanism for determining the validity of firmware updates, so a remote attacker may be able to install custom firmware that operated as a DDoS client or a network sniffer. Similarly, an attacker could produce an invalid firmware revision that would disable the device completely, leaving victims no alternative but to return the disabled unit to the manufacturer.",

  "Overview": "The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has recently discovered several vulnerabilities in the Alcatel Speed Touch line of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. These vulnerabilities are the result of weak authentication and access control policies and result in one or more of the following impacts: unauthorized access, unauthorized monitoring, information leakage, denial of service, and permanent disability of affected devices. The SDSC has published additional information regarding these vulnerabilities at http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/.",
