  "ID": "VU#878044",
  "IDNumber": "878044",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object that can be accessed by the impersonated user. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Net-SNMP",
    "UCD-SMNP",
    "HMAC",
    "SNMPv3"
  ],
  "Overview": "A vulnerability in the way implementations of SNMPv3 handle specially crafted packets may allow authentication bypass.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade This vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.4.1.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.2.4.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.0.11.1 and UCD-SNMP 4.2.7.1. Please see the Net-SNMP download page. Alternatively, consult your vendor. See the Systems Affected section below for more information. Apply a patch Net-SNMP has released a patch to address this issue. For more information refer to SECURITY RELEASE: Multple Net-SNMP Versions Released. Users are encouraged to apply the patch as soon as possible. Note that patch should apply cleanly to UCD-snmp too.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem The configuration should be modified to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key. This option does not encrypt the HMAC, but does minimize the possible affects from this vulnerability."
