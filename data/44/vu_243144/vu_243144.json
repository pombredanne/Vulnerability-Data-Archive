  "Description": "CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchonization ('Race Condition') - CVE-2016-5195 The Linux kernel since version 2.6.22 contains a race condition in the way the copy on write mechanism is handled by the memory subsystem. A local attacker may leverage this vulnerability in affected systems to gain root privileges. For more information, including proofs of concept, refer to the Dirty COW disclosure page. Note that this vulnerability is reported as being actively exploited in the wild.",
