  "Description": "Many home and office/home office (SOHO) routers have been found to be using vulnerable versions of the Allegro RomPager embedded web server. Allegro RomPager versions prior to 4.34 contain a vulnerability in cookie processing code that can be leveraged to grant attackers administrative privileges on the device. According to Check Point's advisory, the vulnerability was addressed by Allegro in 2005 but is present in current or recent firmware releases of many devices.",
