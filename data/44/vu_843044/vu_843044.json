  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2014-8272 The IPMI v1.5 implementations in multiple Dell iDRAC releases, including versions of iDRAC6 modular/monolithic and iDRAC7, are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection due to use of predictable and limited session ID values. Session IDs are assigned incrementally rather than randomly, enabling an authenticated user to predict subsequent session IDs based on his own session. However, due to the small pool of possible session ID values, brute force guessing attacks are viable and authentication is not necessary. Dell has issued the following statement: The legacy nature of the IPMI 1.5 protocol exposes several weaknesses in the overall design and implementation. These are: Use of an insecure (unencrypted) channel for communication. Poor password management including limited password length. Limited session management capability. These weaknesses are inherent in the overall design and implementation of the protocol, therefore support for the IPMI 1.5 version of the protocol has been permanently removed. This means that it will not be possible to reactivate or enable it in an operational setting. Dell's full statement can be viewed in Vendor Information below.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update Dell has released the following updates that completely remove IPMI v1.5 code: iDRAC6 modular \u2013 version 3.65\niDRAC6 monolithic - version 1.98\niDRAC7 \u2013 version 1.57.57 Note that removing IPMI v1.5 is a violation of the IPMI v2.0 specification, section 13.4, which requires backwards compatibility with IPMI v1.5. Other than requiring users to adopt IPMI v2.0 at the exclusion of the insecure IPMI v1.5, no additional impact of the violation is known. Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Dell advises the following: DRAC\u2019s are intended to be on a separate management network; they are not designed nor intended to be placed on or connected to the internet. Doing so could expose the connected system to security and other risks for which Dell is not responsible. Along with locating DRACs on a separate management subnet, users should isolate the management subnet/vLAN with technologies such as firewalls, and limit access to the subnet/vLAN to authorized server administrators.",
