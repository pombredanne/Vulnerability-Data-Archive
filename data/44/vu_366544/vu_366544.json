  "Description": "Adtrustmedia PrivDog is a Windows application that advertises \"... safer, faster and more private web browsing.\" Privdog installs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy as well as a new trusted root CA certificate. The MITM capabilities are provided by NetFilterSDK.com. Although the root CA certificate is generated at install time, resulting in a different certificate for each installation, Privdog does not use the SSL certificate validation capabilities that the NetFilter SDK provides. This means that web browsers will not display any warnings when a spoofed or MITM-proxied HTTPS website is visited. We have confirmed that PrivDog version 3.0.96.0 is affected. Adtrustmedia PrivDog is promoted by the Comodo Group, which is an organization that offers SSL certificates and authentication solutions. Users can test whether they are vulnerable to the PrivDog vulnerability and other similar vulnerabilities by visiting Filippo Valsorda's SSL test page.",
