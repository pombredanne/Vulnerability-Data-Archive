  "Description": "There is a security hole in Red Hat 2.1, which installs the game abuse,\n/usr/lib/games/abuse/abuse.console suid root.  The abuse.console program\nloads its files without absolute pathnames, assuming the user is running\nabuse from the /usr/lib/games/abuse directory.  One of these files in the\nundrv program, which abuse executes as root.  If the user is not in the\nabuse directory when running this, an arbitrary program can be substituted\nfor undrv, allowing the user to execute arbitrary commands as root. \n   If abuse.console needs to be run by users other than root at the console,\nprovisions need to be made in the code to not execute or load any files\nas root.\n \n                   Program: /usr/lib/games/abuse/abuse.console suid root\nAffected Operating Systems: Red Hat 2.1 linux distribution\n              Requirements: account on system\n                     Patch: chmod -s /usr/lib/games/abuse/abuse.console\n       Security Compromise: root\n                    Author: Dave M.
