  "Workarounds": "Do not access untrusted Office documents This vulnerability can be triggered by accessing a specially crafted Office document, or by accessing the folder containing that document. Do not access unfamiliar or unexpected Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010 for more information. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Office to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with the appropriate Office application. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, .xls, and .ppt) will not detect all Office documents."
