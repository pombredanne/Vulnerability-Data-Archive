  "Workarounds": "Disable Drag and Drop Disable Microsoft Internet Explorer's \u201cDrag and Drop or copy and paste files\u201d feature as discribed in Microsoft Security Bulletin ms06-072. Disable scripting Disable scripting as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. See Microsoft Security Bulletin ms06-072 for details on workarounds."
