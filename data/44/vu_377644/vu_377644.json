  "Description": "Note: A prior version of this report indicated incorrectly that Ektron CMS version 9.1 was vulnerable. The vendor indicated that the last version to ship with this vulnerability was version 9.0. CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') - CVE-2015-0923\nEktron Content Management System version 8.5, 8.7, and 9.0 contain a XXE vulnerability in /Workarea/ServerControlWS.asmx. The parameter xslt of the method ContentBlockEx allows a remote unauthenticated user to read arbitrary files. CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection') - CVE-2015-0931\nEktron Content Management System version 8.5, 8.7, and 9.0 contain a resource injection vulnerability by using an improperly configured XML parser. By default, Ektron utilizes the Microsoft XML parser to parse XSLT documents, which is not vulnerable. If an attacker specifies use of the Saxon XSLT parser instead, and sends it a specially crafted XSLT document, the attacker may be able to run arbitrary code at the privilege level of the application. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2015-0923.",
