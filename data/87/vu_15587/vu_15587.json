  "Description": "There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in versions of Communicator up to 4.07 (confirmed) and potentially 4.5 as well. Reportedly this overflow only affects UNIX versions of Communicator but this is unconfirmed at this point. \n\nThe overflow is in the code that creates dialog boxes when a plugin of an unknown MIME type is requested. The code creates the message using sprintf() into a 1K buffer and there is no bounds checking done on the string representing the MIME type.",
