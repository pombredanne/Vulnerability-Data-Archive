  "Workarounds": "I have the following suggestion for a fix of ypupdated. It\nrestricts the legal mapnames to those that consists of\nalphanumericals and a dot. I think that should be sufficient\nto close the hole. (Of course under the assumption that\nisalnum() does not let through any shell-special chars, which\nI hope it doesn't.) This fix does not care about internationalization at all,\nperhaps someone that's good at that could modify it in appropriate\nways. I don't know if this works on different plotforms,\neither."
