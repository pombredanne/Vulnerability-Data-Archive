  "Description": "CWE-255: Credentials Management - CVE-2016-6554 Synology NAS servers DS107, firmware version 3.1-1639 and prior, and DS116, DS213, firmware versions prior to 5.2-5644-1, use non-random default credentials of:  guest:(blank) and admin:(blank) . A remote network attacker can gain privileged access to a vulnerable device.",
  "ID": "VU#404187",
  "IDNumber": "404187",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can take complete control of a device using default admin credentials.",
  "Keywords": "default credentials",
  "Overview": "Synology NAS servers DS107, DS116, and DS213, use default credentials.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an Update Firmware version 5.2-5644-1 for the DS116 and DS213 will require a strong password for the default admin account. For the DS107 and for guest accounts, implement the following workarounds.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Disable Default Accounts The latest firmware versions for all affected devices allow the default guest account to be disabled. The latest firmware for the DS116 and DS213 allow the default admin account to be disabled. Use strong passwords Use of strong, unique passwords can help reduce the efficacy of brute force password guessing attacks. Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow trusted hosts to connect to the device."
