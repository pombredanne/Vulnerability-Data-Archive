  "Description": "Problem:       Upon successfully logging into a system with uucpd,\n               the daemon will attempt to record wtmp information.\n               However, due to insufficient bounds checking, a buffer\n               overflow can result when uucpd attempts to copy the\n               connecting hostname into a buffer with a predefined size.\n \n               While overwriting the buffer, the attacker can manipulate\n               the stack and execute their own commands, possibly gaining\n               root access into the system.\n \n               The attacker must have an account on the system, which\n               will allow this to be exploited.\n \n               This problem is present in BNU uucpd.  This is not\n               installed by default on every operating system.\n               This also may not always run as root.\n \n               Known vulnerable Operating Systems include:\n \n               OSF 1.0, 2.0,\n               SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.4\n               Solaris 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5.1\n               NetBSD 1.3, 1.3.1\n               OpenBSD 2.1, 2.2\n \n               Operating Systems not vulnerable:\n \n               FreeBSD 2.x\n               BSDi 2.x, 3.x\n               RedHat Linux 4.x, 5.x\n               Slackware Linux 3.x\n \n               For more information on this type of attack, point your\n               web browsers to http://www.repsec.com/bofs.html.\n \nSolution:      A generic patch has been made publically available by the RSI staff.",
