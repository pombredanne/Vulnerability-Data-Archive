  "ID": "VU#9888",
  "IDNumber": "9888",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers can direct large amounts of UDP traffic to victim hosts, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Keywords": [
    "UDP",
    "denial of service",
    "flood",
    "spoof"
  ],
  "Overview": "Connectionless UDP protocols are susceptible to multiple forms of denial-of-service attacks, most of which make use of IP spoofing.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "Use filtering to block unecessary protocols Site administrators should make use of both host-based and network-based filtering technologies to prevent unecessary traffic from traversing their networks.",
