  "VendorStatement": "NIXU ADVISORY ON VU#725188 Nixu NameSurfer Suite All Nixu NameSurfer versions ship with a proprietary primary DNS server is\nnot affected by VU#725188. Therefore, when Nixu NameSurfer is run as the\nprimary DNS server, no action is required to protect the master DNS server\nagainst this threat. Nixu NameSurfer Suite 6.5.2 ships with an optional companion BIND 9.6.1\nserver that can be installed on the same server running Nixu NameSurfer\nSuite. If the companion BIND 9.6.1 server has been activated at install and\nis used to run localhost (127.0.0.1) as a master zone, Nixu recommends\neither of the following approaches: 1) the master zone on localhost BIND is disabled\n2) the localhost BIND is patched to version 9.6.1-P1 Please note that a failure in the localhost BIND due to the vulnerability\noutlined in VU#725188 does not pose any threat to authoritative DNS zones\nfor which Nixu NameSurfer Suite is the master, i.e. Nixu NameSurfer primary\nDNS server will continue to serve the (remote) secondary DNS servers even if\nthe optional local BIND server failed. Nixu Secure Name Server (SNS) Nixu SNS secondary server instances hosting slave copies of master zones\nmanaged in Nixu NameSurfer primary are not affected by VU#725188."
