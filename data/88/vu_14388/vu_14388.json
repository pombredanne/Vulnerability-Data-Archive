  "Description": "1) These systems generally do not check hostnames by identd.  Hence,\nhostnames can be spoofed in HELO with the result the person can\nsend essentially untracable email that can only be properly traced\nby examination of system logs.\n\n2) Many of these programs have a separate bug in which one cannot block\nthird-party relaying.  It is fairly rare third-party relaying is\nneeded, and malicious third parties often exploit these systems to\nsend UCE, mailbombs, etc.",
