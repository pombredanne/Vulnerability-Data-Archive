  "Description": "On Tektronix X terminals running Tek Xpress software, release 8.1 patch\nlevel 47, the \"display access table\" (where the xhost information is\nstored) is NOT reset between X sessions.",
  "ID": "VU#18388",
  "IDNumber": "18388",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If more than one person uses an X terminal, then one user may inherit xhost\nentries from a previous user of the terminal. This may allow the first\nuser (or anyone on one of the hosts he has authorized) to run clients on\nthe X terminal while the second user is using it, allowing him, for example,\nto capture keystrokes, take a snapshot of the screen, etc. This may also\nbe a vulnerability if only one person uses the X terminal, if that person\nexpects the xhost table to be cleared between sessions.",

  "Workarounds": "(A) Reboot the X terminal between sessions. (B) Edit the XDM scripts to clear the xhost table between session. (a) Create Xreset and Xsetup scripts in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm to remove\nthe xhost entries. (Both are advisable since Xreset will not be run if the\nXDM host crashes and Xsetup will not be run if the user connects to XDM on\na machine outside your organization.) This files can have the same\ncontents: #! /bin/sh\n# Clear X host table. Presumes /usr/X11R6/bin is in PATH\nxhost - > /dev/null\nfor h in `xhost | tail +2`; do xhost -$h > /dev/null; done (b) Add to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config the following lines: DisplayManager*setup:           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup\nDisplayManager*reset:           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xreset (c) Send a HUP signal to xdm. Depending on your configuration, this may be\none of kill -HUP `cat /etc/xdm-pid`\nkill -HUP `cat /var/run/xdm-pid`\nkill -HUP `cat /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-pid` etc. (A) By default, Tektronix X terminals like to have the X terminal itself in\nthe display access table. Workaround (B) removes this entry. This may\naffect the running of local clients. If this is a problem, the user can\nuse xhost to add the X terminal again. (B) Marty Duvall (martyd@vnd.tek.com) is looking into this issue. He is\nchecking which versions of the Tektronix X terminal software have this\nproblem. (C) NCD X terminals do not suffer from this problem provided their boot\nconfiguration files contain xserver-retain-x-settings = false\nxserver-access-control-enabled = true\nxserver-access-control-enabled-default = true I don't think workstation based X servers have this problem provided there\nare no files\n/etc/X*.hosts\npresent on the system. (D) Of course, no-one should be using host-based authentication for X. However, VMS systems seem to offer no alternative for users whose X session\noriginated on a Unix System. (I can't find the equivalent of the xauth\ncommand or the $XAUTHORITY file.) Also many of our users have yet to learn\nhow to use xauth."
