  "ID": "VU#836088",
  "IDNumber": "836088",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Email anti-virus and content filters may not detect viruses, malicious code, or other restricted content that is sent as \"message/partial\" MIME parts in multiple email messages. Such messages may be automatically reassembled by MUAs, thus delivering the virus, malicious code, or restricted content to users.",
  "Keywords": [
    "RFC 2046",
    "message fragmentation and re-assembly",
    "Outlook Express",
    "message/partial",
    "MIME"
  ],
  "Overview": "Email anti-virus scanners and content filters from multiple vendors do not adequately check messages containing \"message/partial\" MIME entities (RFC 2046). As a result, viruses, malicious code, or other restricted content may not be detected.",

  "Workarounds": "Block \"message/partial\" MIME Types If possible, configure your mail server, firewall, or other gateway technology to block messages containing \"message/partial\" MIME parts. Note that this will disable the intended functionality of this MIME type, and users will be unable to send or receive messages containing \"message/partial\" parts. Disable Message Reassembly If possible, configure your MUA to not reassemble fragmented messages automatically. This will prevent your MUA from reassembling any \"message/partial\" MIME entities, whether or not they are malicious. Use Desktop Anti-Virus Software Deploy and maintain updated desktop anti-virus software."
