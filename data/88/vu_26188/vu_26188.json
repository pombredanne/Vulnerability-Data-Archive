  "ID": "VU#26188",
  "IDNumber": "26188",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Keys produced non-interactively with PGP v5.0 on a system with a /dev/random device may be predictable, especially those produced in an environment without a pre-existing randseed.bin file. Documents encrypted with a vulnerable key may recoverable by an attacker. Additionally, an attacker may be able to forge a digital signature corresponding to a vulnerable key. Signatures produced using a vulnerable key, including signatures in certificates, may be untrustworthy.",

  "Overview": "Under certain circumstances, PGP v5.0 generates keys that are not sufficiently random, which may allow an attacker to predict keys and, hence, recover information encrypted with that key.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "If your PGP key was generated non-interactively using any version of PGP v5.0 on a system with a /dev/random device, you may wish to revoke it. Documents encrypted with a predictable key may need to be re-encrypted with a non-vulnerable key, if your particular circumstances warrant it; that is, if the information still needs to be encrypted. You may need to resign documents signed with a vulnerable key if your circumstances warrant it.",
