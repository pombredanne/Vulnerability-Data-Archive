  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-0777 According to the OpenSSH release notes for version 7.1p2 : The OpenSSH client code between 5.4 and 7.1 contains experimental support for resuming SSH-connections (roaming). The matching server code has never been shipped, but the client code was enabled by default and could be tricked by a malicious server into leaking client memory to the server, including private client user keys. The authentication of the server host key prevents exploitation by a man-in-the-middle, so this information leak is restricted to connections to malicious or compromised servers. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2016-0778 According to Qualys, the API functions packet_write_wait() and ssh_packet_write_wait() may overflow in some scenarios after a successful reconnection. Qualys also notes that: The buffer overflow, on the other hand, is present in the default configuration of the OpenSSH client but its exploitation requires two non-default options: a ProxyCommand, and either ForwardAgent (-A) or ForwardX11 (-X). This buffer overflow is therefore unlikely to have any real-world impact, but provides a particularly interesting case study. For more information, please see Qualys's advisory. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-0777.",

  "IDNumber": "456088",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A user that authenticates to a malicious or compromised server may reveal private data, including the user's private SSH key, or cause a buffer overflow that may lead to remote code execution in certain non-default configurations.",
