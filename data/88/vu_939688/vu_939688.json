  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view an HTML document (e.g., a web page or HTML email messsage), an attacker could cause arbitrary script to execute in the Local Machine Zone. Depending on the patch level of the target machine, it may be possible for the script to download and execute arbitrary code.",

  "Workarounds": "Install update Install the appropriate update referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-001. This update does not remove the vulnerability, but it provides a mitigating factor. With the update, the HTML Help control cannot be used by HTML documents that reside outside of the Local Machine Zone. This helps prevent an attacker from using the HTML Help control to execute script. Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Local Machine Zone will prevent widely used payload delivery techniques from functioning. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. By default, the Local Machine Zone (My Computer) is not displayed in the Security tab of the Internet Options dialog box. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 315933 for information about accessing the security settings for this zone. Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Local Machine Zone may prevent several Windows components from functioning properly. Disable \"Drag and drop or copy and paste files\" Disabling the zone security preference \"Drag and drop or copy and paste files\" prevents drag and drop operations. One way for exploits to deliver arbitrary files to the target machine is via drag and drop. While this setting does not remove the vulnerability, it does prevent an attack vector. Note: This preference is not honored with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems that do not have the MS04-038 update (VU#630720). Without the patch, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 will always allow drag and drop events to occur, regardless of the zone security setting. After the patch in MS04-038 is installed, the preference to disable drag and drop events is honored. However, in our testing, the \"Prompt\" option now behaves the same as \"Disable\" with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. If set to \"Prompt,\" the drag and drop events will not occur, and there will be no prompt."
