  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2014-2962 Belkin N150 wireless router firmware versions 1.00.07 and earlier contain a path traversal vulnerability through the built-in web interface. The webproc cgi module accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input. The web server runs with root privileges by default, allowing a malicious attacker to read any file on the system.",
  "ID": "VU#774788",
  "IDNumber": "774788",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker that is connected to the router's LAN may be able to read critical system files on the router.",

  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The vendor had previously indicated that the vulnerability was resolved in firmware version 1.00.08; however, recent reports indicate that firmware version 1.00.08 failed to address the issue and that version 1.00.09 is vulnerable as well. Users should consider the following workaround:",
