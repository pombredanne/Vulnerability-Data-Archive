  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Restricting public access to vulnerable systems mitigate this vulnerability. Access control lists, management VLANs, or alternate connection methods such as modem or console ports can be used to allow restricted access to the device. Disable Services Disabling IPv4 functionality on devices using IPv6 may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. For more information about these and other workarounds, see the workarounds section of Cisco Security Advisory 20070124."
