  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2015-8286 According to the researcher, the Swann SRNVW-470LCD and Swann SWNVW-470CAM contain a hard-coded passwords allowing administrative or root access. Other models may also be affected. Current evidence suggests that the source of the hard-coded passwords in these models is CVE-2015-8286. The CERT/CC has published VU#899080 regarding CVE-2015-8286. However, the CERT/CC has not been able to confirm this with Swann. CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel - CVE-2015-8287 According to the researcher, a remote attacker with knowledge of the correct URL may be able to stream the live video feed from an IP camera connected to the NVR. This URL does not authenticate users before displaying the video feed.",
  "ID": "VU#923388",
  "IDNumber": "923388",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain root access to the device, or view the live video feed.",

  "Overview": "Swann network video recorder (NVR) devices contain a hard-coded password and do not require authentication to view the video feed when accessing from specific URLs.",
  "References": "http://www.swann.com/us/swnvw-470kit",
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a full solution to these issues. Swann has stated that the hard-coded password issue has been addressed in firmware v2.6.0.1 of older DVR devices, firmware v0114 for the NVW-470LCD, and firmware v1022 for the NVW-470CAM. Updated firmware can be obtained from the Swann support portal. However, the researcher disputes this update and has stated that the new NVW-470 firmware does not appear to address the issue. Swann has currently not replied to further inquiries regarding this dispute from the CERT/CC. You may also consider the following mitigation:",
