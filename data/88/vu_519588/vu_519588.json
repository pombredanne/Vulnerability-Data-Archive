  "Description": "According to JasperSoft's website: \"JasperReports Server is a powerful, yet flexible and lightweight reporting server. Generate, organize, secure, and deliver interactive reports and dashboards to users. Allow non-technical users to build their own reports and dashboards.\" The JasperSoft's JasperServer fails to adequately randomize certain parameters within the application creating cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. According to the vulnerability reporter \"One of the parameters (_flowExecutionKey)is predictable and can be determined with a very high probability of success in bruteforce attacks with less than 100 requests\". This vulnerability has been reported to affect JasperServer 3.7.0 Community Edition and JasperServer 3.7.1 Community Edition. Other versions may be affected.",
  "ID": "VU#519588",
  "IDNumber": "519588",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to load a specially crafted URL while authenticated to a JasperServer, an attacker could obtain user credentials or perform certain actions as that user. Exploiting the CSRF vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take certain actions via the web interface, including adding users to the JasperServer.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Consider setting up management networks as separate and dedicated channels. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a JasperServer using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
