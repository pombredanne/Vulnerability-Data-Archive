  "Description": "The listen(2) system call used for setting up TCP sockets\nfor TCP servers has an extremely limited number of pending half-open\nconnections available. The relevant kernel parameter is SOMAXCONN.\n\nSOMAXCONN is now typically set to 5. Eric suggests that it should be\nat least 128 but Ken Adelman (Adelman@TGV.COM) points out this opens\na different denial of service attack>  \"now a machine sending you\nSYN packets is going to tie up a significant amount of memory resources\n(mbufs) in the kernel handling these 1/2 connections. In machines with\nlimited mbuf space, this could be a problem.  For example, a typical\nmachine running our TCP/IP product would have 30 listens pending.\nTimes 128 connections and 128 bytes-per mbuf (3 per connection) is\nalmost 1.5MB; far more than the 512K default we (or the BSD kernel\ntypically) allows for this.\"\n\nThis kind of attack is impossible to trace to its source without a\nhop-by-hop monitoring of the network paths, beginning at the attacked\nhost, because no established two-way communication path is required.\nIf it were multisource, well...",

  "Impact": "Once a site has SOMAXCONN pending connections on a given TCP port,\nsubsequent TCP SYN packets from any other source are dropped until one\nor more of the pending connections is completed, or timed out. This\nincludes packets originating from the local host(!). The host/port combination will appear to be offline since it will not\nrespond to TCP SYN packets on the attacked port - \"connection timed\nout\".",
