  "IDNumber": "212088",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Unless the user or internet service provider changes the default password of an affected device, a remote attacker can access the modem via TELNET, HTTP, or FTP. In the case of TELNET and HTTP, this vulnerability grants the attacker read and write access to device configuration. For FTP, this vulnerability allows the attacker to browse the file structure of the affected device.",

  "Overview": "The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has recently discovered several vulnerabilities in the Alcatel Speed Touch line of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. These vulnerabilities are the result of weak authentication and access control policies and result in one or more of the following impacts: unauthorized access, unauthorized monitoring, information leakage, denial of service, and permanent disability of affected devices. The SDSC has published additional information regarding these vulnerabilities at http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Set a password for your ADSL modem Because the Alcatel ADSL modems ship without a password by default, an attacker may be able to gain access if this password has not been set. Users are encouraged to set a password when the device is first configured.",
