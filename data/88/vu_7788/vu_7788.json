  "Description": "Legitimate Java applets -- that is, Java applets behaving precisely\naccording to the spec -- can be used to subvert some dynamic packet\nfilters.  Specifically, they can send messages back to the originating\nhost that tricks the firewall into opening up dangerous ports.\n\nThe easiest way to launch the attack is for the applet to\ncontact the FTP server on the originating machine.  It then sends a\nPORT command listing the host and port number of some vulnerable\nservice.  That conditions the firewall to permit an incoming call to\nthat host and port -- but what if it's the telnet port or the sendmail\nport or what have you.",
