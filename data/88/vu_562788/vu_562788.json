  "Workarounds": "Do not open web browsers with administrator privileges Do not use an administrator account to browse the Internet. See the Before You Connect a New Computer to the Internet document for information about how to create an account with limited privileges. If logged in with administrator privileges, consider using the runas command to run Internet Explorer with reduced privileges. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, but it may reduce the immediate impact of successful exploitation."
