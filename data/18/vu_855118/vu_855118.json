  "Workarounds": "Do not access PICT files from untrusted sources Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted PICT file (typically .pct). By only accessing PICT files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. Attackers may host malicious PICT files on a website. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
