  "Description": "OpenSSL Security Advisory [2 December 2010] OpenSSL Ciphersuite Downgrade Attack A flaw has been found in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code where an old bug\nworkaround allows malicous clients to modify the stored session cache\nciphersuite. In some cases the ciphersuite can be downgraded to a weaker one\non subsequent connections. The OpenSSL security team would like to thank Martin Rex for reporting this\nissue. This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2010-4180 OpenSSL JPAKE validation error Sebastian Martini found an error in OpenSSL's J-PAKE implementation\nwhich could lead to successful validation by someone with no knowledge\nof the shared secret. This error is fixed in 1.0.0c. Details of the\nproblem can be found here: http://seb.dbzteam.org/crypto/jpake-session-key-retrieval.pdf Note that the OpenSSL Team still consider our implementation of J-PAKE\nto be experimental and is not compiled by default. This issue is tracked as CVE-2010-4252 Who is affected? All versions of OpenSSL contain the ciphersuite downgrade vulnerability. Any OpenSSL based SSL/TLS server is vulnerable if it uses\nOpenSSL's internal caching mechanisms and the\nSSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG flag (many applications enable this\nby using the SSL_OP_ALL option). Users of OpenSSL 0.9.8j or later who do not enable weak ciphersuites are\nstill vulnerable but the bug has no security implications as the attacker can\nonly change from one strong ciphersuite to another. All users of OpenSSL's experimental J-PAKE implementation are vulnerable\nto the J-PAKE validation error. Recommendations for users of OpenSSL Users of all OpenSSL 0.9.8 releases including 0.9.8p should update\nto the OpenSSL 0.9.8q release which contains a patch to correct this issue. Alternatively do not set the SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG\nand/or SSL_OP_ALL flags. Users of OpenSSL 1.0.0 releases should update to the OpenSSL 1.0.0c release\nwhich contains a patch to correct this issue and also contains a corrected\nversion of the CVE-2010-3864 vulnerability fix. If upgrading is not immediately possible, the relevant source code patch\nprovided in this advisory should be applied. Any user of OpenSSL's J-PAKE implementaion (which is not compiled in by \ndefault) should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.0c.
