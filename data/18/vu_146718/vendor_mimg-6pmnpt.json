  "VendorStatement": "Sidewinder G2 Security Appliance Not Vulnerable The standard defensive coding and configuration practices used on the Sidewinder G2 Security Appliance preve\nnt this attack from interrupting the flow of mail through the system. In a standard configuration, attack m\nessages will be rejected as invalid without causing an abnormal termination of sendmail. Due to the defensi\nve design of the system, even if an attack message were able to cause an instance of sendmail to terminate, \nit would not prevent other messages from being delivered. As a matter of best practices and defense in depth, the sendmail update will be included in a future patch. Cyberguard Classic & TSP Not Vulnerable Cyberguard Class and TSP do not make use of sendmail for mail delivery."
