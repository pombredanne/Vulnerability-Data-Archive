  "VendorStatement": "Red Hat distributes Sendmail in all Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases. By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Sendmail is configured to only accept connections from the local host. Therefore, only users who have configured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts would be remotely vulnerable to this denial of service issue. Updated Sendmail packages will shortly be available along with our advisory at the URL below. At the same time users of the Red Hat Network will be able to update their systems using the 'up2date' tool. https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0515.html"
