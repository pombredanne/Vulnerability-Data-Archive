  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
