  "Workarounds": "Workarounds BlackBerry provides the following workaround: BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrators can exclude Microsoft Word (.doc) files from being processed by the Attachment Service in the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, or disable the Attachment Service completely. To Exclude Microsoft Word (.doc) files from being processed by the Attachment Service: On the desktop, click Start > Programs > BlackBerry Enterprise Server > BlackBerry Enterprise Server Configuration. In the Format Extensions field, delete the .doc extension. Note: Format Extensions is an editable field that lists all the extensions that the Attachment Service will open. A colon is used as a delimiter. Click Apply, then click OK. Even though the .doc extension has been removed from the list of supported file types, the Attachment Service may automatically detect a .doc file with a renamed extension and attempt to process the file. Administrators may need to disable the Attachment Service. To disable the Attachment Service\nIn Microsoft Windows\u00ae Administrative Tools, double-click Services. Right-click BlackBerry Attachment Service, then click Stop. Close the Services window."
