  "Description": "eject(1) is a program used to eject a removable media device, such as\nfloppy, CDROM, or tape. If the floppy or CDROM is mounted, eject will\nfirst try to unmount it.\n\nDue to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\neject program while it is executing.  By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the eject program, intruders may be able to force eject\nto execute arbitrary commands.  As eject is setuid root, this may\nallow intruders to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
