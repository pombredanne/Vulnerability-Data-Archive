  "Description": "Quantum Scalar i500, Dell ML6000 and IBM TS3310 enterprise tape libraries contain multiple web interface and preconfigured account password vulnerabilities. The Quantum Scalar i500 and Dell ML6000 tape libraries contain the following web interface vulnerabilities. CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\nThe web interface allows an unauthenticated remote user to view any file on the web server, for example http://device/logShow.htm?file=/etc/shadow (CVE-2012-1841). CWE-200: Information Exposure\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability in http://device/checkQKMProg.htm allows compromise of active session ids (CVE-2012-1842). CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nA command-injection vulnerability in http://device/saveRestore.htm (via the fileName POST parameter) allows execution of arbitrary commands as the root user, by an authenticated remote web user (CVE-2012-1843). CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\nThe Quantum Scalar i500, Dell ML6000 and IBM TS3310 tape libraries also contain preconfigured passwords for certain accounts which are considered to be weak and could be exploited allowing an attacker user access (CVE-2012-1844). The CVSS metrics below apply to CVE-2012-1844.",
  "ID": "VU#913483",
  "IDNumber": "913483",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to a local user account or via malicious URL can execute arbitrary code or commands on the vulnerable system. It has been reported to us that customer data residing on the tapes within the libraries are not affected.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade firmware Quantum has released a firmware update i7.0.3 (604G.GS00100) or greater will correct these issues. Dell firmware update A20-00 (590G.GS00100) or greater will correct these issues. IBM firmware update R6C (606G.GS001) or greater will correct these issues.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a Quantum Scalar i500, Dell ML6000 and IBM TS3310 tape libraries using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
