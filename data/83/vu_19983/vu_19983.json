  "Description": "This is not a vul in the application programs (SLIRP, TIA) as such.\nRather it is another example of broken protocols like NFS and\nrsh/rlogin making network configuration more difficult than it\nneeds to be.\n\nA user on an NFS client (typically) depends upon the host operating\nsystem to handle NFS mounting from the NFS server because the user\nis not allowed to do a \"mount\" without root privileges.  The NFS\nserver depends on the NFS client to authenticate the user.  Thus\nwhen the NFS server daemon receives a message that Joe User (uid =\n2000, gid = 99) wants to mount /export/home/ju, it makes sure that\nuid 2000 or gid 99 has permission to mount that directory and then\nlets the client mount it.  The daemon trusts that it really is joe\nuser that is requesting the file handle.  (Note: The file handle is\nthe descriptor that the server uses to refer to a given file.  It\nconsists of the file system identifier, the file identifier, and a\ngeneration count.  Part of the file handle is a 32 bit random field\nusing the time of creation (down to the millisecond) as its seed.\nThis random field makes the file handle hard to guess thus helping\nprevent attackers from spoofing the file handle.)\n\nAlthough a user cannot just use the \"mount\" command to gain access\nto NFS mounted files, she can write a script that will talk\ndirectly to the NFS daemon on the server and masquerade as any user\nshe wants.  Most NFS filesystems are configured such that the\nsuperuser on a client machine maps to the \"nobody\" ID on the\nserver.  Thus, it typically does not do much good to claim to be\nroot.  For this reason, all system files that are mountable should\nbe owned by root (other privileged accounts do not necessarily map\nto nobody).  Writing a script to talk to the server daemon requires\nthat the user be familiar with the NFS protocol.  Programs such as\nSLIRP and TIA (The Internet Adapter), work in much the same way as\nthe exploit script in that they are able to talk directly with the\nNFS daemon.  When a user dials into an NFS client from his PC and\ntries to mount his files from the server, SLIRP makes the request\nto the NFS server daemon for him.  Because the user can be anyone\nhe wants to be on his PC, he can pose as anyone for the NFS server\nand mount anyone's files.  Again, the user would not have root\naccess if the server mounts root to nobody.",
