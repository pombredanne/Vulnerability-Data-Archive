  "Description": "This is quoted from the report sent to us.\n\nYet another Linux 2.1 exploit script.\n\n\n   There is a major security hole in rxvt, a terminal emulator for X, when it\nis run on systems suid root, as is required on many configurations in order to\nwrite to the utmp file.  It is obvious from the code that this program was\nnot written to be run suid root, its a pity that sysadmins that install the\ncompiled versions of this sort of code don't see the same warnings of 'run \nsuid root at your own risk' that the people that put together a distribution\nwith it that way see in the makefile.\n   The conditions that allow this particular hole to be exploited is rxvt\ncompiled with the PRINT_PIPE option, and is running suid root.  The program\nsets the pipe to \"lpr\", without a pathname, but its even easier than that\nto exploit because we can set the pipe to whatever we want with the -print-pipe\noption on the rxvt command line.  Although the programs gives up its root \nprivileges when forking to runn a shell or other command, the original program\ncontinues running suid root the entire execution of the program.\n   Because the popen() call runs as root, whatever program that pipe opens\nwill execute immediately as root.  In order to start the printer pipe, the\nvt100 printer-on command is ESC[5i.  The pipe can then be closed with the\nprinter-off commad, ESC[4i.  Exploiting this is extremely easy.\n\n                   Program: rxvt \nAffected Operating Systems: Linux Slackware 3.0, RedHat 2.1, others with\n                            rxvt suid root (and compiled with PRINT_PIPE)\n              Requirements: account on system, X server \n           Temporary Patch: chmod -s /usr/X11R6/bin/rxvt\n       Security Compromise: root\n                    Author: Dave M. (davem@cmu.edu)\n                  Synopsis: rxvt fails to give up root privileges before\n                            opening a pipe to a program that can be specified\n                            by the user.",
