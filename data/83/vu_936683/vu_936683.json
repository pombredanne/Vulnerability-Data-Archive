  "Impact": "It is possible to cause a denial of service against the RADIUS server  with a malformed Vendor-Specific attribute. Though unlikely, if a RADIUS client processes the Vendor-Specific attribute contained in a server response, then the client may also be vulnerable.",

  "Overview": "Various RADIUS servers and clients permit the passing of vendor-specific and user-specific attributes. Several implementations of RADIUS fail to check the Vendor-Length of the Vendor-Specific attribute. It's possible to cause a denial of service against RADIUS servers with a malformed Vendor-Specific attribute.",
