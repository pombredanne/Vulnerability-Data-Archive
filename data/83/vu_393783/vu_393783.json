  "Description": "Service Location Protocol is an IETF standards track protocol that provides a framework to allow networking applications to discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise networks. The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of Service Location Protocol. When OpenSLP parses a SLP packet containing malformed extensions the extensions parser will enter an infinite loop causing a denial-of-service condition. If an attacker creates a packet containing a \"next extension offset\" pointing to itself or to a previous extension, the extension's parser will enter an infinite loop consuming 100% of the CPU.",
