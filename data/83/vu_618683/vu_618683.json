  "Description": "Key Systems Electronic Key Lockers run a management listener on tcp/1010 which is used for communication between the electronic key locker and the master authentication server. It is possible for an attacker to send plaintext commands to tcp/1010 to have the electronic key locker perform various functions such as unlock, lock or change the device's configuration. (CVE-2012-2988) The Key Systems Electronic Key Locker also contains a web server which is vulnerable to weak authentication. The authentication credentials required to log into the web server are a username and a 4 digit PIN number which can be easily brute-forced using a HTTP GET request, http://x.x.x.x/?Function=Auth&authorize=on&uid=admin&login=5555. (CVE-2012-2989)",
  "ID": "VU#618683",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the Key Systems Electronic Key Locker can perform various functions such as unlock, lock or change the device's configuration or brute-force  web server management user accounts.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Overview": "Key Systems Electronic Key Lockers contain a command injection vulnerability which may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject commands into the electronic key locker. Key Systems Electronic Key Lockers also contains weak authentication which could allow an attacker administrative access to the electronic key locker.",
