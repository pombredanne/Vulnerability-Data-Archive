  "Description": "According to HomeSeer's website, \"HomeSeer HS2 is an advanced home automation and remote access software package that is designed to integrate the major systems of any home\". The HomeSeer HS2 home automation software webserver contains multiple vulnerabilities. HomeSeer HS2 2.5.0.20, and possibly prior versions, includes a web interface which contains a directory traversal vulnerability which could allow an attacker to access files outside of the web directory. In addition the HomeSeer HS2 web interface is vulnerable to a stored and reflective cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can request a web page such as http://ipaddress/example<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>, causing the JavaScript to be stored in the log viewer page. The next time an administrator or user within the web application views the logfile (http://ipaddress/elog), the JavaScript will be executed in their browser session. The HomeSeer HS2 web interface is also vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks with within the /ctrl URL. A successful CSRF attack against an admin user will\u00a0allow a remote attacker to run commands as the admin user, including remotely launching known executable files on the system.",

  "IDNumber": "796883",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the HomeSeer HS2 web interface can conduct a cross site scripting attack, which could be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service. In addition an attacker with network access to the HomeSeer HS2 web server may also be able to run system commands, inject arbitrary data, or download arbitrary files.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a HomeSeer HS2 using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
