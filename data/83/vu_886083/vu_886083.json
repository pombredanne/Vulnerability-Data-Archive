  "Overview": "SecurityFocus and CORE Security Technologies have reported a vulnerability in WU-FTPD. WU-FTPD does not handle file name globbing properly and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. WU-FTPD is a widely-used FTP daemon that is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions. This vulnerability was discussed on SecurityFocus' vuln-dev mailing list in April 2001.",

  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict Access\nBlock or restrict access to the control port used by WU-FTPD, typically 21/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to WU-FTPD. Disable Anonymous Access\nDisable anonymous FTP access. Note that this will only prevent unauthenticated users from attempting to exploit this vulnerability. Disable Vulnerable Service\nDisable WU-FTPD until a patch is can be applied."
