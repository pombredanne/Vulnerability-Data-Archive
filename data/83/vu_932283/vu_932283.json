  "Workarounds": "Disable \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" In Internet Explorer, a plugin is used to view, play, or otherwise process embedded documents. The execution of embedded documents is controlled by the \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" security option. Disabling this option will prevent embedded documents from being processed, and therefore prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. At a minimum, disable the \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" security option in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook or Outlook Express. Instructions on how to set the security level for the Internet zone to \"High\" can be found in the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. In the \"High\" security level, the \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" security option is disabled. From MS02-005: The vulnerability could not be exploited if the \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" security option were disabled in the Security Zone in which the page was rendered. This is the default condition in the Restricted Sites Zone, and can be disabled manually in any other Zone. Apply Outlook Email Security Update Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6, and Outlook 98 and 2000 with the Outlook Email Security Update applied, open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone. The \"Run ActiveX Controls and Plugins\" security option is disabled by default in the Restricted Sites Zone."
