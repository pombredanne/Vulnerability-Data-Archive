  "Description": "The threat, posted on BugTraq, involves the unauthorized, remote\naccessing and simple decryption of encrypted private keys for users\nof Microsoft Windows 95 and Internet Explorer 3.0.\n\nThe threat involves two viable, distinct vulnerabilities.\n\n(1) Internet Explorers CryptoAPI is poorly implemented.  This can\nlead to the unauthorized decryption of private keys.\nThis was assigned a threat metric of:\nIH1=20,IH2=10,IH3=3,IH4=15,T1=8,T2=10,T3=10 = 7.4 : 7.4 : 9.7\n\nOriginal Post:\nThe Crypto Algorithm used by Internet Explorer is insecure.\nThe first 100-odd bytes of the key data blob are protected\nby the insecure PKCS #8 format and can be recovered by a\nsimple XOR.  Fixed, known plaintext is encrypted by the\ninsecure RC4 method.  These two faults can be used\nleveraged together to quickly (1-2 sec) decrypt a private\nkey.\n\nRuss Cooper:\nIts the older, but still supported, version of IE (3.0) with\nthe weak RC2 stream-cipher encryption mechanism.   The\ncurrent version of IE (4.0) uses (the strong) DES\nblock-cipher for the encryption.\n\nMicrosoft:\nThe risk is NOT with the CryptoAPI (cryptographic toolbox)\nsoftware but, with the third-party Cryptographic Service\nProviders (CSPs) software.  IE 4.0, current version, uses\nPKCS-12 for securing exchanged key material.  However the\nimplementation of PKCS-12 does not include an iteration\ncount because, it was added late in the product evolution.\n\nCERT:\nThe problem seems to be with MS's implementation of\nthe PKCS-12 encryption software.  PKCS-12 is used to\nencrypt exchanged key material (e. g., the exported key\nblob file) in the current version (4.0) of Internet Explorer.\nThe weakness comes from the fact that MS uses an\nimmature version of PKCS-12, a version that it does not\ninclude an iteration count, unlike the mature, much more\nsecure version that Netscape uses for the same purpose.\n\n(2) remote user's can access any user's encrypted keys.\nThis was assigned a threat metric of:\nIH1=20,IH2=10,IH3=3,IH4=10,T1=15,T2=20,T3=18 = 33.4 : 33.4 : 43.5\n\nAn ActiveX Control run via IE on a Windows 95 platform can\naccess the users private keys.  This is because the control\nis run with the users privileges and, as such, can access\nthe users private keys.  For this to happen a user must\naccept an unsigned ActiveX control from an hostile website.\n\nMicrosoft:\nSavvy users wouldn't accept an unsigned ActiveX control.\nRecommends storing key material in hardware tokens (i.e.,\na separate physical hardware key storage mechanism).\n\n\nNet Result:\nBy combining these two vuls (which is what the BugTraq\nposting suggests) the cumulative threat emerges, that is\nthe unauthorized remote accessing and quick decryption\nof encrypted private keys.",
