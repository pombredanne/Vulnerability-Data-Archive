  "Description": "NetReveal is an enterprise software designed to detect financial fraud and organized crime in data, intended for financial sector and government use. According to BAE Systems, NetReveal is deployed as a customized instance for each customer. Certain deployments of NetReveal contain multiple vulnerabilities, including allow privilege escalation. CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key By manipulating certain values of a POST request, an attacker can escalate privileges from Fraud Analyst to Administrator when performing some system tasks. According to BAE Systems, these POST parameters are unique to each deployment, making it less likely for an attacker to guess the appropriate value without already knowing Administrator credentials. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') An attacker with administrator access may conduct stored cross-site scripting attacks using certain parameters of the NetReveal EIM component. CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') An attacker with administrator access can upload a specially-crafted XML file that results in system information disclosure in the browser, which can be leaked to other parties. The reporter identifies version 6.5.2.20 as being affected; other versions may also be affected. According to BAE Systems, these vulnerabilities exist in customized sections of code that have seen only very low deployment; not all installations of NetReveal may be vulnerable to these issues. BAE Systems encourages customers concerned about potential impacts on their own deployments to contact them directly at <https://support.ai.baesystems.com> for software update and remediation advice. The CVSS score below is based on the authorization bypass.",
