  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers may abuse HTTP TRACK functionality to gain access to information in HTTP headers such as cookies and authentication data. In the presence of other cross-domain vulnerabilities in web browsers, sensitive header information could be read from any domains that support the HTTP TRACK method.",
  "Keywords": [

    "HTTP TRACK method"
  ],
  "Overview": "Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) servers support a HTTP method called TRACK. The HTTP TRACK method returns the contents of client HTTP requests in the entity-body of the TRACK response. This behavior could be leveraged by attackers to access sensitive information, such as cookies or authentication data, contained in the HTTP headers of the request.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Microsoft IIS 6 is reported to be not vulnerable. The TRACK method can be added to Microsoft's URLScan DenyVerbs section. It should not be in the AllowVerbs section in the urlscan.ini file.",
