  "Overview": "Part of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification (RFC 1122) allows a receiver to advertise a zero byte window, instructing the sender to maintain the connection but not send additional TCP payload data. The sender should then probe the receiver to check if the receiver is ready to accept data. Narrow interpretation of this part of the specification can create a denial-of-service vulnerability. By advertising a zero receive window and acknowledging probes, a malicious receiver can cause a sender to consume resources (TCP state, buffers, and application memory), preventing the targeted service or system from handling legitimate connections.",

  "Resolution": "Modifications can be made to TCP implementations, interfaces, operating systems, and network applications, however any changes should consider the balance between improved resiliency and decreased interoperability. The IETF TCPM is considering the problem and  any potential changes to TCP or guidance to implementors. As of the publication of this vulnerability note, the IETF has not yet decided whether additional clarifications of the TCP specifications are necessary. Some vendors have implemented changes to improve resiliency against zero window and other TCP state attacks. Consider the analysis and advice provided in the CPNI assessment.",
  "Revision": 123,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "Generally, any system or product that implements or uses TCP could be affected by this vulnerability, depending on how the product handles resource exhaustion and TCP connections in persist. By design, TCP does not inherently defend against denial-of-service attacks based on resource exhaustion. Decisions about how to detect and respond to such attacks are the responsibility of individual systems or products. Please see the CERT-FI Advisory on the Outpost24 TCP Issues for further vendor information.[<br><br>]",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "Thanks to Mahesh Jethanandani and CERT-FI for their efforts researching and coordinating vendor responses to this vulnerability. Thanks also to Barry Greene, Lars Eggert, Wesley Eddy, and David Borman for their review and comments.",

  "Workarounds": "Abort misbehaving TCP connections under resource exhaustion conditions The consensus of the TCPM discussion seems to be that an operating system or application that faces resource exhaustion can selectively abort TCP connections that appear to be malicious (i.e., in persist condition and consuming relatively large amounts of memory). TCP must implement the persist behavior in RFC 1122, but a higher protocol layer can decide to abort a connection for any reason, including resource exhaustion. How and when to abort connections are open questions, and beyond the scope of the TCP protocol specification. Section 7 of the \"Clarification...\" I-D describes an approach in which an application can limit how long the underlying TCP socket should tolerate connections in the persist condition. However, section 7.1.2 of the CPNI assessment warns that \"...an attacker could simply open the window (i.e., advertise a TCP window larger than zero) from time to time to prevent this enforced limit from causing his malicious connections to be aborted.\" A system that aborts TCP connections too aggressively is likely to drop legitimate connections. Carefully consider the likelihood of attack, the cost of dropping legitimate connections, and the benefit of dropping malicious connections before making design or configuration changes to TCP components of operating systems and applications. It is unlikely that one setting will work well for every TCP system. Restrict Access Restricting access or limiting connections to TCP services using firewalls can mitigate zero window attacks, at the cost of potentially blocking legitimate connections."
