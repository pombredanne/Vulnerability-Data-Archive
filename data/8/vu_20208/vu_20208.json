  "Description": "The same startup vulnerability that you mentioned in CA-93:19 also\napplies to Ultrix 4.3. I have found that a few appropriately placed\nCtrl-Cs during the initial fsck cause it to exit, leaving the user in\na root shell.",
  "ID": "VU#20208",
  "IDNumber": "20208",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows anyone with physical access to the\nsystem console to gain root access.",

  "Workarounds": "Suggested by reporter: My own workaround to this was to replece the exit commands in the\n/etc/rc with halt commands. Since I have a CMOS password set, the intruder\ncan only boot the system in multi-user mode. I do not believe that Ultrix has an sulogin command, but logging\nability would be nice in this situation."
