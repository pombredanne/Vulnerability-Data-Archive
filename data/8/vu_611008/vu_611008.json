  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application that uses the vulnerable function. The scope of the impact depends on how the affected application works. Applications that process filename input from the network, such as some web applications, would be vulnerable to a remote attacker. Applications that only process filename input from a local user would only be vulnerable to a local attacker. Note that applications may be linking to the MFC library dynamically or statically. It will be necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to the MFC library.",

  "Workarounds": "Note, however, that the MFC libraries can be used by multiple applications on most systems. Once a solution is made available by the vendor, it may be necessary for application users (system administrators, developers) to upgrade or apply multiple patches and then recompile statically linked applications. Applications that are statically linked must be recompiled using patched libraries. Applications that are dynamically linked do not need to be recompiled; however, running services need to be restarted in order to use the patched libraries. System administrators should consider the following process when addressing this issue: Patch or obtain updated MFC libraries. Restart any dynamically linked services that make use of the MFC libraries. Recompile any statically linked applications using the patched or updated MFC libraries. Note this is an iterative process for each set of patches being applied."
