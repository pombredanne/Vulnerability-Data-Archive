  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability may permit a malicious server to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user that invoked the telnet client. An attacker would have to trick a victim into initiating a telnet connection using a vulnerable client. This may be accomplished with an HTML rendered email or web page, using the TELNET:// URI handler, however further user interaction may be required.",
