  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Set and Enforce Password Checking Policies Site administrators are encouraged to regularly check users' passwords and enforce policies that promote strong passwords. This includes such measures as requiring regular password changes, testing proposed passwords before accepting them, and maintaining a password history to prevent users from reusing passwords. Use Alternate EAP Authentication Mechanisms The Cisco LEAP is one of several EAP authentication mechanisms available for IEEE 802.1X networks. Cisco has introduced the EAP-FAST authentication mechanism to address this vulnerability; for more information, please see the Cisco Bulletin. Sites that require restricted access networks should evaluate all available options for authentication."
