  "Workarounds": "Disable the AcroPDF ActiveX control According to Adobe Security advisory APSA06-20, the AcroPDF ActiveX control can be disabled by taking the following steps: Exit Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader. Browse to <volume>:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat 7.0\\ActiveX. Note: If you did not install Acrobat to the default location, browse to the location of your Acrobat 7.0 folder. Select AcroPDF.dll and delete it. Disable the AcroPDF ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The Adobe AcroPDF ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {CA8A9780-280D-11CF-A24D-444553540000} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{CA8A9780-280D-11CF-A24D-444553540000}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0"
