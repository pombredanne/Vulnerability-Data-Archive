  "Description": "A NeXT system can be coerced to crash simply by\nconnecting to its nmserver port via telnet.  Any\nuser can do this regardless of status.  The\nfailure stems from unbounded memory consumption\nand results in a complete system failure curable\nonly by a reboot.\n\ntelnet hostname 2453\n\nthen type some input.  nmserver on host\n\"hostname\" will consume all available memory\n(virtual memory as well) and down the machine.\nDisconnecting from the port doesn't stop it, but\nif nmserver can be killed and restarted in time,\nthe system might be saved.",
