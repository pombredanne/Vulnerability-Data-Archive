  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2015-8262 The Buffalo AirStation Extreme N600 Router WZR-600DHP2 uses static source ports and predictable TXIDs that increment from 0x0002 for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause WZR-600DHP2 LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control. The following graph shows a distribution of 300 DNS queries captured on the WAN port of the WZR-600DHP2:",
