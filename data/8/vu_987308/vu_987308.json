  "Description": "According to HP's website: HP LoadRunner software is the industry standard for performance validation. It allows you to prevent application performance problems by detecting bottlenecks before a new system or upgrade is deployed. HP LoadRunner contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing Virtual User script (.usr) files containing long strings for directives, causing the HP LoadRunner application to crash.",
