  "Description": "The Serva32 2.1.0 TFTPD service contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing large read requests. When the application reads in a large buffer the application crashes.",
  "ID": "VU#127108",
  "IDNumber": "127108",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can pass large read requests against the application causing it to crash.",
  "Keywords": [
    "serva32",

    "buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Overview": "Serva32 2.1.0 TFTPD service contains a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "References": "http://www.vercot.com/~serva/",
  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
  "Revision": 19,

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict Network Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from connecting to the service from a blocked network location."
