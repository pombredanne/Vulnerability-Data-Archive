  "Description": "The X11 program xdm if setuid can be used to gain root access to a\nsystem or cause denial of service attacks by over writing system\nfiles.  The files that are created are owned by root.\n\nOn Unix Ware system the /usr/X/bin/xdm program is setuid.  The xdm\nprgram by default uses the /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config file as\ndefault.  A local user can copy this file from the\n/usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config directory to their home directory and\nmodify where certain files are created.\n\nThen, by executing the following command:\n\nxdm -c ./my-xdm-config-file\n\nxdm will create the files that were specified in the\nmy-xdm-config-file file in system critical areas such as /.",
  "ID": "VU#20108",
  "IDNumber": "20108",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Local users can gain root access, create and/or corrupt system\ncritical files such as /etc/passwd, and .rhosts by using the X11\nxdm program. In addition, this vulnerability can cause denial of\nservice attacks.",
