  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2016-6566 According to the reporter, the valueAsString parameter inside the JSON payload contained by the ucLogin_txtLoginId_ClientStat POST parameter is not properly validated. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to modify the POST request and insert a SQL query which may then be executed by the backend server. According to the reporter, eTRAKiT 3.2.1.17 was tested, but other versions may also be vulnerable.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
