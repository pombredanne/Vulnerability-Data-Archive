  "Workarounds": "Run Apache with User privileges On Windows NT, 2000, and XP systems, the Apache service can be configured to run as a specified user instead of local SYSTEM. By carefully specifying the privileges of the Apache user, an administrator can restrict the ability of a CGI program to access files and execute commands."
