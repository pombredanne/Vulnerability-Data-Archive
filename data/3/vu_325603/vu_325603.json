  "Resolution": "Apply patches rsync version 2.5.7 has been released and contains patches to address this vulnerability. Users using packaged versions of the rsync software are encouraged to review the vendor information in the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. Users compiling the rsync software from the distribution source code can obtain the patched version from the rsync homepage.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Administrators, particularly those who are unable to apply the patches in a timely fashion, are encouraged to consider implementing the following workarounds: Disable the rsync service on systems that do not require it to be running. Filter access to the rsync service. The rsync service normally runs on port 873/tcp. Limiting access to this port from trusted clients may reduce exposure to this vulnerability."
