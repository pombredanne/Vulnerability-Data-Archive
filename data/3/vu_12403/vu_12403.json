  "Description": "Any SunOS 4.x setup that involves diskless clients and that is\nconfigured according to default procedures is vulnerable to this\nproblem. Most likely, other setups that involve diskless NFS\nclients (Ultrix) become vulnerable after person name's program (a\nprogram that uses direct RPC calls to create set-uid root\nexecutables) has been ported to those environments.",

  "Impact": "Yet another \"everyone is root in a matter of seconds\" report, with\nsource, example and counter measure. This is a combined report on progress by person name (of SunOS 4.x\nin.telnetd fame) and a bug report on the SunOS 4.1.1 \"nosuid\" mount\noption. Recently, person name has been working on a program that uses direct\nRPC calls to create set-uid root executables.",
