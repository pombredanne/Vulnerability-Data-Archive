  "Description": "The Solaris 2.x pututxline subroutine writes out the supplied\nutmpx structure into the utmpx file.  The only check that\npututxline has is that the login name in the utmpx entry must\nmatch that of the caller's and that the utmpx device entry\nis a real device writable by the caller.\n\n(From the Solaris 2.4 man page)\nWhen called by a non-root user, pututxline() invokes a setuid()\nroot program to verify and write the entry, since /etc/utmpx\nis normally writable only by root.  In this event, the\nut_name field must correspond to the actual user name associated\nwith the process; the ut_type field must be either USER_PROCESS\nor DEAD_PROCESS; and the ut_line field must be a device special\nfile and be writable by the user.\n\nIt is the case that /usr/lib/utmp_update takes as arguments\nthe fields specified in the utmpx header file and anyone\ncan call this program which is setuid root.  The 95.13995\nCERT mail gives exploit scripts for in.comsatd and in.talkd\nthat count on utmp being changed with /usr/lib/utmp_update.",

  "Impact": "A user can at least obscure the fact that they are logged into\nthe system. The reporter does suggest the following: Now the trick here is also to exploit this enough so that you\ncan change your ttyname (which can easily be done) and manipulate\na system utility into writing to that new ttyname (which could\nbe a system file). This example only takes you out of the utmp\nfiles. One can become root.",
