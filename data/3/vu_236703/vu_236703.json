  "Description": "An authenticated user with no permission to a project can subscribe to the project, delete files, and possibly take other actions by loading a specifically crafted URL. Specific fields for the URL would most likely not be known to the attacker but a brute force attack could still be used to try all possibilities. ActiveCollab 2.3.1 is known to be vulnerable. Earlier versions may be vulnerable as well.",
  "ID": "VU#236703",
  "IDNumber": "236703",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An authenticated attacker could view or modify projects they are not assigned to, resulting in loss of data integrity and confidentiality. An unauthenticated attacker may use a cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attack to trick an authenticated user into visiting a specifically crafted malicious URL as well.",
