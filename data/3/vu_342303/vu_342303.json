  "IDNumber": "342303",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker on the same network as the iOS device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS, which may lead to the exposure of sensitive account information, including login credentials.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ssl",
    "validation",
    "certificates"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Pandora iOS app fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may enable an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not use affected versions of the application The features and services provided by the application are likely accessible via the Pandora web site. By using a web browser to access those resources, you may avoid situations where SSL is not validated. Avoid untrusted networks Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack."
