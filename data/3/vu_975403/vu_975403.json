  "Impact": "The CORE SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES report describes several different attacks including remotely deleting arbitrary files and remotely creating arbitrary directory entries. In addition, attackers might be able to crash the ToolTalk RPC database server, denying service to legitimate users. It could be possible for attackers to execute arbitrary code and commands, although this has not yet been demonstrated. The ToolTalk RPC database server typically runs with root privileges.",

  "Overview": "The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server does not adequately validate a client-supplied argument, allowing attackers to overwrite certain locations in memory with zeros. This vulnerability could be exploited in a number of ways, potentially allowing attackers to:  cause a denial of service, remotely delete arbitrary files, remotely create arbitrary directories, and potentially execute arbitrary code or commands.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable rpc.ttdbserverd Until patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to consider disabling the ToolTalk RPC database service. As a general best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. The ToolTalk RPC database service may be enabled in /etc/rpc or in /etc/inetd.conf. On a Solaris 8 system, comment out the following entry in /etc/inetd.conf to disable the ToolTalk RPC database service (rpc.ttdbserverd): # Sun ToolTalk Database Server 100083/1        tli     rpc/tcp wait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserverd rpc.ttdbserverd The rpcinfo(1M) and ps(1) commands may be useful in determining if you system is running the ToolTalk RPC database server. On a Solaris 8 system, the following examples indicate that the ToolTalk RPC database server is running: # rpcinfo -p | grep 100083\n    100083    1   tcp   32773 # ps -ef | grep rpc.ttdbserverd\n    root   355   164  0  19:31:27 ? 0:00 rpc.ttdbserverd Block or Restrict Access Until patches are available and can be applied, block or restrict access to the RPC portmapper service and the ToolTalk RPC database service from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Using a firewall or other packet-filtering technology, block the ports used by the RPC portmapper and ToolTalk RPC services. The RPC portmapper service typically runs on ports 111/tcp and 111/udp. The ToolTalk RPC service may be configured to use port 692/tcp or another port as indicated in output from the rpcinfo command. Keep in mind that blocking ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable service from the internal network. It is important to understand your network configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate."
