  "Description": "This vulnerability allows a perpetrator to use\nan innocuous Web document to load a Trojan horse virus from a browser\nwindow W\ninto a new browser window X. For all Web documents subsequently loaded\ninto\nwindow W, this Trojan horse can:\n- observe URLs of visited documents\n- observe any data interactively filled into HTML forms\n- observe values of cookies\n- observe contents of password fields in forms(on Windows)\n- dynamically change contents of the action URL of forms, thus enabling\nthe hijacking of form data (tested only on Netscape)\n- observe form, password, and cookie information even from 'secure'\nHTTPS-based documents. These documents are protected while data moves\nover the network, but no protection is provided for the data while in\nthe browser, from where it can be stolen.\n\nThe Trojan horse can use HTTP, and possibly Java applets or ActiveX\nscripts to send the captured information back to a desired location,\ncompletely unbeknownst to the user.",
