  "Overview": "Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is the operating system for the majority of Cisco routers. Open Shortest-Path First (OSPF) is an interior routing protocol. A flaw in some Cisco IOS versions can allow a buffer overflow when handling a large number of OSPF neighbor connection requests.",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround Filter OSPF Packets If upgrading is problematic, you can configure the router to filter OSPF packets. OSPF communicates using the IP protocol \"ospf\" and can be filtered as that protocol. Unlike TCP-based and UDP-based protocols, no port number is required. See Cisco's Response for its instructions on how to configure the filtering."
