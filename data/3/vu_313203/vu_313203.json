  "Impact": "A malicious user can execute arbitrary script/HTML code in the security context of who ever viewed the logs, typically an administrator.",
  "Keywords": [

    "SOHO Content Filtering Application",
    "malicious script code",
    "log file",
    "DoS",
    "denial of service"
  ],
  "Overview": "Sonicwall allows administrators to block websites based on a user specified list of domain names. These domains are blocked whenever they accessed by clients on the LAN interface and can be logged to a log file. If a user inputs a crafted URL which included malicious script/HTML code, then the script/HTML would be interpreted if logs when the logs were viewed with an html browser.",

  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
