  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can construct forged data in a variety of forms that will cause software using the MD5 algorithm to incorrectly identify it as trustworthy. Because the underlying vulnerability occurs in a cryptographic primitive, specific exploitation scenarios vary widely depending on the nature of the data the attacker has the ability to spoof and how it is validated by software. In a particularly egregious vulnerability scenario, a victim user may be mislead into supplying sensitive information to a malicious website believing that it is authentic based on an apparently valid signed SSL certificate.",

  "Overview": "Weaknesses in the MD5 algorithm allow for collisions in output. As a result, attackers can generate cryptographic tokens or other data that illegitimately appear to be authentic.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not use the MD5 algorithm\nSoftware developers, Certification Authorities, website owners, and users should avoid using the MD5 algorithm in any capacity. As previous research has demonstrated, it should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use. Scrutinize SSL certificates signed by certificates using the MD5 algorithm\nUsers may wish to manually analyze the properties of web site certificates that are signed by signing certificates using the MD5 algorithm. The procedures for accessing certificate details differ depending on the software in use but the signature algorithm is often identified in the \"Signature algorithm\", \"Certificate Signature Algorithm\", or similarly named field. Users of systems with the OpenSSL command line utility can view certificate properties using \"openssl x509 -text\" or a similar utility. Certificates listed as md5RSA or similar are affected. Such certificates that include strange or suspicious fields or other anomalies may be fraudulent. Because there are no reliable signs of tampering it must be noted that this workaround is error-prone and impractical for most users."
