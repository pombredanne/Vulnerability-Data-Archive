  "Impact": "By supplying a specially crafted TIFF image as an email attachment and convincing a user to view the image on a BlackBerry Handheld, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service to the Blackberry Attachment Service. A denial of service may only affect some users, and the Attachment Service may start new threads immediately or after a specified time period (25 minutes by default).",
