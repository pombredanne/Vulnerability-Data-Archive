  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nManageEngine AssetExplorer version 5.6.0 build number 5610 and possibly older versions is vulnerable to multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities via XML asset data submission. Asset data is submitted by a program on client systems in an XML format via a POST request to http://[hostname]:8989/discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?COMPUTERNAME=[computer name]. This submission is not authenticated. It has been reported that several of the data fields in that XML document are not properly filtered on ingestion by the XML processor or on output in the HTML interface. An example of a vulnerable element is the DocRoot/Computer_Information/output element. The value supplied to this element is echoed verbatim when viewing the asset in AssetExplorer, potentially resulting in a persistent XSS attack.",
  "ID": "VU#571068",
  "IDNumber": "571068",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the ManageEngine AssetExplorer web interface can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which could be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the ManageEngine AssetExplorer web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
