  "Description": "VTScada is software designed by Trihedral to provide Internet access and control capabilities to SCADA-based\ntechnologies. The vulnerability identified allows Internet access by a default user (Manager 1) using the default\npassword. Note: such a password configuration is not by default, and access using the default password has to\nbe enabled by the administrator responsible for the software use. In addition, VTScada software has to be\nplaced on the Internet without a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or behind the protection of a firewall. In response, the following mitigation advice was provided by Trihedral to verify the proper configuration of the\nsystem: 1. The Manager1 account has been deleted (preferred). 2. The password for Manager1 has been changed from the default. 3. The Internet Client Access is not enabled for the Manager1 account. 4. The VTS computer is not accessible from the Internet using a non-secured HTTP connection on port 80. If any of the previous advice is true, users of VTScada software will not be subject to the threat.
