  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2015-2897 Sierra Wireless GX, ES, and LS gateways running ALEOS contain multiple hard-coded accounts with root privileges. These accounts are enabled by default and accessible by telnet or SSH in systems using ALEOS 4.3.4 or earlier. The accounts also exist and are enabled in versions 4.3.5 to 4.4.1, though remote access is disabled by default.",

Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using credentials from a blocked network location. Refer to the Sierra Wireless technical bulletin for more information about restricting access."
