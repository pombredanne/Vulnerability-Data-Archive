  "ID": "VU#342768",
  "IDNumber": "342768",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links in /tmp with appropriate names, an attacker could cause getty_ps to overwrite files writeable by the effective UID of this package. Since this package is normally run as root, any file on the system could be thus corrupted.",

    "getty_ps",
    "race",
    "symlink",
    "temporary",
    "tmp"
  ],
  "Overview": "getty_ps is an open-source software package designed to support logons to the console and terminals. Some implementations create temporary files insecurely with predictable names, leading to corruption of arbitrary files via symbolic link attack.",
