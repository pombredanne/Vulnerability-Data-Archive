  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2015-8263 The Netgear G54/N150 Wireless Router WNR1000v3 uses static source ports for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause WNR1000v3 LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control. The following graph shows a distribution of 229 DNS queries captured on the WAN port of the WNR1000v3:",
