  "Impact": "An intruder who exploits this vulnerability can remotely execute arbitrary code. On UNIX systems, this code runs as the 'oracle' user. From there, it is likely that an intruder could leverage that access to gain additional control over the system. If running on Windows systems, the intruder's code will run in the Local System security context. In either case, the data contained in the database is at risk.",

  "Overview": "There is a buffer overflow in several versions of Oracle Database. The impact of this vulnerability may include the execution of arbitrary code; the ability to read, modify, or delete information stored in underlying Oracle databases; and denial of service.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch, as described in Oracle Security Alert 57. Note that Oracle has indicated the following in their security alert, \"Currently, due to architectural constraints, there are no plans to release a patch for versions 9.0.1.4, 8.1.7.4, 8.1.6.x, 8.1.5.x, 8.0.6.3, 8.0.5.x, 7.3.x, or other patchsets of the supported releases.\"",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround Until you can apply a patch, you may wish to follow the advice outlined in David Litchfield's Bugtraq post: Alternatively customers can disable external procedure functionality. To do this edit the listener.ora file, removing the entries for extproc, and also delete the extproc binary which can be found in $ORACLE_HOME/bin. It is important to understand your service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate."
