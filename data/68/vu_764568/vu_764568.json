  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to subvert security software to deliver malicious content to a vulnerable system. If that attacker can persuade the vulnerable user to access a specially crafted image via a web browser, that attacker may be able to bypass anti-virus scanning to deliver malicious image to a vulnerable system. According to public reports, this vulnerability may be exploited to deliver the GDI+ exploit described in MS04-028 and VU#297462.",
