  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - CVE-2015-0933 ShareLaTeX 0.1.3 and previous versions allow a remote user to obtain information about other users or the server on which ShareLaTeX is installed by allowing a user to \\include{} any valid absolute path name in the document, which is then forwarded to the latex process. When processed, the output document will contain the contents of the file specified. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')  - CVE-2015-0934 ShareLaTeX prior to version 0.1.3 allows a remote user to run commands on the server with the permissions of the ShareLaTeX process by not properly filtering out backticks from the names of files. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-0934.",
  "ID": "VU#302668",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "CVE-2015-0933 allows a remote authenticated user to obtain information about other users or the server on which ShareLaTeX is installed. This information can include information like user accounts, which may be used to mount further attacks against the server. CVE-2015-0934 allows a remote authenticated user to run commands on the server with the permissions of the ShareLaTeX process. Note that user authentication as of ShareLaTeX 0.1.3 is currently limited to registering an email address and does not require moderator/administrator approval. Therefore it is possible for an authenticated user to remain anonymous.",
