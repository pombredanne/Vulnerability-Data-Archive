  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted Excel documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Excel or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010. Disable automatic opening of Excel documents By default, Excel 97 and Excel 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Excel documents. This feature can be disabled by using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool. Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Excel to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if spreadsheet.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open presentation.qwer with Excel. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .xls and .xlt) will not detect all Excel documents. Additionally, a Excel file with no file extension will also open with the Excel application."
