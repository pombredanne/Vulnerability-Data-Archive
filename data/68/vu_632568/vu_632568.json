  "Impact": "An attacker may craft a special filename to obtain arbitrary file access (as the webserver process) if the realpath() implementation is vulnerable and certain functions are used on user-supplied data. Note that not all operating systems will have a vulnerable PHP implementation. OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD are among those operating systems which are reportedly affected.",

  "Overview": "Improper file truncation in the PHP internal function realpath() may lead to remote arbitrary file access.",
