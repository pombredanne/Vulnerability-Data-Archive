  "Workarounds": "Do not click on links Do not follow links from emails or instant messages. Always access the management interface by typing in the web address or using a known good bookmark. Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the site using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
