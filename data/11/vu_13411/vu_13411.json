  "Description": "From the SNI advisory draft:\n\nProblem 1: File creation\n\nThis problem is present since lpd fails to check the filenames\nbeing uploaded by print clients.  lpd supports the uploading of\nfiles by remote print clients which can consist of print queue\nfiles, and datafiles to be printed.  By specifying an explicit\npath, an attacker can create files on a remote server.  This\nproblem only allows an attacker to specify a total of 5 characters\nin the path and name of the file, making it's use limited.\n\n* Files are uploaded to lpd by specifying '\\2' with the name of the\n* printer he/she wishes to access.  This calls the recvjob()\n* function in standard BSD lpd's.  The attacker specifies '\\2',\n* which calls the receive file function.  By then specifying the\n* filename and ammount of data to send, the attacker can cause lpd\n* to create filenames up to 5 characters in length (including the\n* pathname).  This is somewhat limited to creating 4 letter files\n* in /, and may not be extremely serious.\n\nProblem 2: File deletion\n\nThis problem uses the technique described in problem #1.  An\nattacker has the ability to create lpd control files.  lpd control\nfiles support various functions such as specifying a file to print\nand removal of files.  Any file which is sent to the remote print\ndaemon which begins with \"cf\" will be treated as a control file.\nBy uploading a control file which utilizes the removal feature, any\nsystem file can be removed.\n\n* wThe attacker utilizes the method in problem #1 to upload a\n* control file with a command 'U/etc/passwd' to remove the password\n* file on the remote system.\n*\n* XXX - Could be used to remove /etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny\n*  /etc/passwd, etc\n\nProblem 3: Remote Execution\n\nThis problem uses the technique described in problem #1.  By\nuploading a lpd control file, the attacker can cause lpd to send\nmail to the user specified in the control file, confirming their\nprint job.  The attacker can cause lpd to run the sendmail command,\nand specify a portion of the control file line on sendmail's\ncommand line.  This can allow an attacker to specify an alternate\nsendmail configuration file, and cause commands to be executed\nremotely.\n\n* The attacker first uploads an alternate sendmail configuration\n* file to the remote system.  This can be done using the technique\n* described in problem #1 (or via ftp).  For example we can upload\n* a file named 'smcf@'.  This will create a file in /var/output/lpd\n* (or where the print spool directory is configured) named \"smcf@\".\n* The attacker now uploads a lpd control file with the following\n* line in it:\n*\n* \tM-C/var/output/lpd/smcf\n*\n* lpd will now try to send mail to -C/var/output/lpd/CONF, but will\n* first append the domain name specified in the control file.\n* Since we have not specified a domain name in the control file,\n* only an '@' is appended, and lpd will run \"sendmail\n* -C/var/output/lpd/smcf@\" Since sendmail config files allow\n* commands to be executed within them during parsing, our commands\n* will be processed.\n*\n* Our alternate sendmail config file needs only to consist of a\n* line as follows:\n*\n* \tFw-o |/bin/touch /tmp/LPD.BUG\n*\n* However can contain commands to open a connection to another\n* system and gain interactive access.",

  "Impact": "If anonymous FTP is enabled on a print client, and attackers can\nFTP bounce off the anonymous FTP server, then remote individuals\ncan create and delete files on the print server and execute\ncommands remotely. If anonymous FTP is not enabled on any print client, but FTP bounce\nis still possible, then an attacker with access to any non-root\naccount on any print client can create and delete files on the\nprint server. If FTP bounce is not possible on any print client, then an attacker\nwith root privileges on any print client can obtain access to the\nprint server.",
