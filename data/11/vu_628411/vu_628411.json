  "Impact": "Exploitation of this read-only directory traversal vulnerability discloses limited types of information. Per the OpenConnect Vendor Statement for VU#628411: The file being accessed must be in ini-style to be parsed within WebConnect. The jretest.html page will attempt to retrieve a user configuration value from that file. When the value is found to be invalid, it is displayed within the returned error html page. This allows the end user to see the value for one key within the ini-style file. The entire file is not displayed to the user nor can the user manipulate the file in any way. This vulnerability is present in all platform versions of WebConnect but is Windows-focused due to the need for the target file to be ini-style.",
