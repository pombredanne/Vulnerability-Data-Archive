  "Description": "This is from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ddean/java/non-expert.html:\n\nMarch 1996: Longer description\n\nWe have discovered a serious security flaw in the Java programming\nlanguage. This flaw exposes users of the Netscape Navigator web browser\nto a risk of having their machine compromised; for example, their data\nfiles could be read, deleted, or corrupted. We have been able to\nexploit this flaw to successfully attack a machine in our own\nlaboratory.\n\nUsers can protect themselves from this risk by disabling Java until the\nflaw is fixed. To disable Java, choose \"Security Preferences\" from the\n\"Options\" menu in Netscape, then click the \"Disable Java\" box.\n\nJava is designed to allow an executable computer program, called an\napplet, to be attached to a page in the World Wide Web. When a user\nbrowsing the Web visits that page, the applet is automatically\ndownloaded into the user's machine and executed.\n\nThe flaw we discovered allows a malicious applet to generate and\nexecute raw machine code. This means that the malicious applet can\nperform any action that the victim can legally perform; for example, it\ncan read, delete, or corrupt the victim's files. Since applets are\nloaded and run automatically as a side-effect of visiting a Web page,\nthe result is that an unscrupulous person could \"booby-trap\" his Web\npage so that anyone visiting the page has his machine compromised. A\nmalicious applet could spread like a virus by attaching itself to the\nWeb pages of its victims, thus making it difficult to trace the\noriginal source of the attack.\n\nAt present we are not releasing technical details about the flaw, in\norder to prevent unscrupulous persons from exploiting it. We will\nannounce the full details later; some of the details will also appear\nin our paper analyzing the security of Java, Java Security: From\nHotJava to Netscape and Beyond, in the 1996 IEEE Symposium on Security\nand Privacy. Preprints will be available at the end of March, please\nsend mail to Ed Felten to request a copy.\n\nThe existence of security flaws in Java does not imply that other,\ncompeting systems are more secure. We chose to study Java because it is\nthe best-known system for attaching programs to Web pages. We suspect\nthat if competing systems were subjected to the same level of scrutiny,\nthey would also be found to have flaws. Building a secure mechanism for\nembedding executable programs in Web pages is an extremely difficult\ntask.\n\n[Note that the \"security enhancements\" announced by Netscape in version\n2.01 of Netscape Navigator do not fix this flaw. They fix two separate\nflaws found last month, one found by us and independently by Steve\nGibbons, and the other found by David Hopwood.]\n\nFor more information contact Ed Felten at (609) 258-5906 or\nfelten@cs.princeton.edu.",
