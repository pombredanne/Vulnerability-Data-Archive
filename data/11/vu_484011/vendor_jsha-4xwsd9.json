Security Bulletin Bulletin Number:          #00206\nDate:                     August 30, 2001\nCross-Ref:                CERT Advisory CA-2001-15\nTitle:                    in.lpd The information contained in this Security Bulletin is provided \"AS IS.\"\nSun makes no warranties of any kind whatsoever with respect to the information\ncontained in this Security Bulletin.

Bulletins Topics Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 8, 7, and\n    2.6 (SunOS(tm) 5.8, 5.7, and 5.6) which relate to an in.lpd\n    vulnerability reported in CERT CA-2001-15. Sun recommends that you install the patches listed in section 4\n    immediately on systems running SunOS 5.8, 5.7, and 5.6 which\n    use in.lpd. 2. Who is Affected Vulnerable:                SunOS 5.8, 5.8_x86, 5.7, 5.7_x86, 5.6,\n                               5.6_x86 3. Understanding the Vulnerability The in.lpd daemon is the BSD print protocol daemon. The in.lpd\n    daemon implements the network listening service for the BSD\n    print protocol specified in RFC 1179. The BSD print protocol\n    provides a remote interface for systems to interact with a\n    local spooling system. CERT Advisory CA-2001-15 describes a\n    buffer overflow in the in.lpd daemon which may crash in.lpd or\n    allow arbitrary code to be executed with elevated privileges\n    on the victim system. The issue was discovered by ISS X-Force\n    who published an advisory at: http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise80.php CERT Advisory CA-2001-15 is available from: http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-15.html 4.
