The receiver uses the URGENT POINTER to determine where in the\nsegment the urgent data ends. Windows NT bugchecks when the URGENT POINTER\npoints to the end of the frame and no normal data follows. Windows NT\nexpects normal data to follow.\n\nMicrosoft has updated Tcpip.sys to correct the problem.",

  "Workarounds": "Patch from MS\nFrom the NT Bugtraq list: 1. YOU MUST APPLY SP2 BEFORE THE OOB-FIX. By Microsoft putting HOT FIX\ncode in a sub-directory of POST-SP2, there really shouldn't be any need\nfor further warnings about what might happen if you apply this to a\nmachine that does not already have SP2. 2. A HOT FIX is DANGEROUS. You shouldn't be applying ANY Hot Fix unless\nyou already understand the need, and READ THE Q ARTICLE that accompanies\nit. Hot Fixes are NOT regression tested, so there is no guarantee that\nthey will work (or that your machine will work) with services and\napplications installed on your system that are not part of the base OS. In the case of Hot Fix releases which come out following Service Pack\nreleases, it is ALWAYS assumed that the system MUST have the latest\nService Pack installed prior to installing the Hot Fix. 3. Once you have applied a Hot Fix to your system (or many Hot Fixes),\nafter you install a new service or application (that modifies anything\nin the registry or anything in or under %systemroot%, you must then\nreapply the Service Pack, and then reapply any Hot Fixes which were\ninstalled. This can be a real pain, but its the only way to ensure that\nyour system is back to the state it was in prior to installing the new\nservice or application. I've asked Microsoft for a better mechanism\n(i.e. to somehow have Hot Fixes include themselves into the SP\ninstallation process when added to a system so all you would have to do\nis reapply the SP). 4. Always make an updated Emergency Repair Diskette prior to installing\nan SP or Hot Fix. You should also do a full backup of the registry, and\nif possible, the entire system. With so many\nservices/applications/hardware drivers available for NT, its impossible\nand unrealistic to expect that Microsoft would be able to test all of\nthese prior to a Service Pack release. Many people will happily install\nupdated drivers for their hardware without a thought as to whether or\nnot its going to be compatible with the OS version (including SP and HF)\nthat they are running. I make it a practice to contact the vendor and\nask them whether or not its been tested with the current SP (at least)\nto ensure I'm not going to screw up a working system. HFs, on the other hand, are done (typically) so fast that its impossible\nto test them even with the current HCL. If you are concerned enough to\nneed a HF, then you need to be able to test it to see if it does what\nits supposed to do, and doesn't stop your system from functioning in\nsome other way. This is just pure common sense. If your system fails after installing an SP or HF, you can recover using\nthe ERD and your backups. 5. If you find yourself in the position that you've ignored the above\nrecommendations, then here are a couple of suggestions from David\nLeBlanc that might help you recover a system that BSOD's on boot; A) Take the HD out, put it in a different machine as a slave,\nboot the other machine and copy an older tcpip.sys over your new one. B) Put a new, temporary install of NT into a separate directory,\nthen copy over the file."
