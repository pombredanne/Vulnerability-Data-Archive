  "Description": "On systems running Transarc's Solaris DCE integrated login program\n(login.dce in place of /bin/login) which have AFS installed but no\nAFS klog binary in any of the standard locations, unauthorized users\nmay gain access to local system resources as any valid user by supplying\na valid username for login, with any arbitrary string as a password.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect interpretation of the\nsituation which occurs when an AFS klog binary is not found by\nlogin.dce.",
  "ID": "VU#13905",
  "IDNumber": "13905",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Users without accounts on the system may gain unauthorized access to\nlocal resources. Access to resources controlled by AFS/DCE/DFS is\nunaffected, as no network credentials are granted unless a valid\npassword is supplied.",

  "Workarounds": "A workaround is possible as well: simply install any program which\nproduces output on stdout in one of the standard klog locations. (A \"hello, world\" program or shell script is sufficient; as long as\nit puts something on stdout, it's good enough. Optimally, install\nthe actual AFS klog program in one of the above locations.) If there is a klog binary in ANY of the following standard locations,\nthe vulnerability will NOT occur: /opt/dcelocal/bin/klog\n/usr/afsws/bin/klog\n/usr/vice/etc/klog"
