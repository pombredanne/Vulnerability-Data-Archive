  "Workarounds": "Limit Access Block or restrict access to the LDAP service (389/tcp or 636/tcp) on affected systems from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Sites, particularly those who are not able to apply the appropriate patches, are encouraged to consider implementing this workaround. Note that this change may break some desired functionality depending on particular site configuration details. As a general rule and a matter of good security practice, the CERT/CC recommends blocking access to all services that are not explicitly required."
