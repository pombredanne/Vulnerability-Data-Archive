  "Workarounds": "Block port 689/tcp As a workaround, system administrators can use a firewall to block port 689/tcp at an appropriate network border, thus preventing external attackers from accessing the vulnerable nmapd.exe daemon. Note that this will not prevent an attack from within the local network."
