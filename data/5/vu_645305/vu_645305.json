  "Description": "The published exploit takes advantage of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Abbrevia 3.05 Beta versions. Abbrevia is a ZIP file handling component that was incorporated into the affected ScadaTEC products. This vulnerability can be exploited by using the application to open a specially crafted ZIP file. The buffer overflow causes the program to crash or possibly allows arbitrary code execution. For additional information see ICSA-11-362-01.",
