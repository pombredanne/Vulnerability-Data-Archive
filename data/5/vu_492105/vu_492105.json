  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on computers where the Remote Agent is installed and gain administrative control. As the Backup Exec Remote Agent may be running on workstations as well as servers, this vulnerability may provide greater opportunity for attack than the other vulnerabilities identified above.",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround Use firewalls to limit connectivity so that only the backup server(s) can connect to the systems being backed up. The standard port for this service is port 10000. At minimum, some basic protection should be in effect at the network boundaries. Individual installations may operate on nonstandard ports, which should be taken into account when developing network traffic filtering rules. Note: even if patching can be done quickly, the above workaround measures should be considered as part of a defense-in-depth strategy for protecting your systems."
