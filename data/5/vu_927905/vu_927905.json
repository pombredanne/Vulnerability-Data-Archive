  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch Users should obtain a patch from their operating system vendor when available. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information about specific vendors. Users who compile their own versions of BIND 8 from the original ISC source code are encouraged to take the following actions described by ISC: This issue is addressed in ISC BIND 8.4.7-P1, available as patch that  \ncan be applied to BIND 8.4.7. The more definitive solution is to upgrade to BIND 9. BIND 8 is being  \ndeclared \"end of life\" by ISC due to multiple architectural issues. See ISC's website at http://www.isc.org for more information and  \nassistance.",
