  "Workarounds": "Disable UPnP\nIf the UPnP service is not needed, disabling it may reduce exposure to this vulnerability. Refer to D-Link's support site for instructions on how to disable UPnP on a particular model of router. The references section of this document has direct links to instructions on how to disable UPnP on some of the affected routers. Restrict access\nRestrict access to the LAN and WLAN interface to trusted hosts only. Preventing network traffic on port 1900/udp from reaching the LAN or WLAN interface may limit exposure to this vulnerability."
