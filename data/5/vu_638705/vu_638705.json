  "Description": "Windows Update/Automatic Updates will detect CC if installed by certain Microsoft software, like Office. Won't detect for non-Microsoft distributions (ISVs). ISVs need to repackage their products with updated CC. ISVs can't point customers to a stand-alone CC updater. You might not be patched for this, here's how to find out, and here's what to do (talk to vendor, killbit...?)",
