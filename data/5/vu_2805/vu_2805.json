  "Description": "A vulnerability in the logging function of xterm exists in many versions of xterm that operate as a setuid or setgid process. The vulnerability allows local users to create files or modify any existing files. \n\nIf the setuid or setgid privilege bit is not set on the xterm program, the vulnerability cannot be exploited. \n\nIt is possible that the xterm on your system does not allow logging. In this case, the vulnerability cannot be exploited. To determine if logging is enabled, run xterm with the \"-l\" option. If an \"XtermLog.axxxx\" file is created in the current directory, xterm supports logging. You can also check the output of \"xterm -help\" to see whether the \"-l\" option is described as \"not supported\". ",
