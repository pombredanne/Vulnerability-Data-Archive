  "Impact": "The HTTP CONNECT method, as well as other HTTP methods and FTP commands, can be abused to establish arbitrary TCP connections through vulnerable proxy services. An attacker could use a vulnerable proxy service on one network as an intermediary to scan or connect to TCP services on another network. In a more severe case, an attacker may be able to establish a connection from a public network, such as the Internet, through a vulnerable proxy service to an internal network. The CERT/CC has received numerous reports of this technique being used to connect to SMTP services (25/tcp) to initiate the delivery of unsolicited bulk email (UCE/SPAM). If a proxy service allows recursive connections, an attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition by consuming resources by making repeated connections from the proxy service back to itself.",

  "Resolution": "Apply Patch or Upgrade Apply a patch or upgrade from your vendor. For information about a specific vendor, check the Systems Affected section of this document or contact your vendor directly. Vendors listed as \"Not Vulnerable\" ship HTTP proxy services with reasonably secure default configurations, meaning that the proxy only allows connections to a limited number of TCP ports, or only listens on an internal or loopback interface, or requires further configuration before it will pass traffic. The vendor ships a secure or disabled proxy, and the responsibility of configuring the proxy is placed on the administrator. Note that almost any proxy service, including those from vendors listed as \"Not Vulnerable,\" can be configured insecurely. Different distributions or packages may configure the same proxy application in different ways.",

  "Workarounds": "Secure Proxy Configuration Check the configuration of your proxy services to determine if they allow connections to arbitrary TCP ports and whether they allow connections from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Configure your proxy services to only allow connections from trusted networks to reasonably safe TCP ports such as HTTP (80/tcp) and HTTPS (443/tcp). If possible, configure your proxy services not to allow recursive connections. For more information about specific products, check the Systems Affected section of this document, consult your product documentation, or contact your vendor. Examine Tunneled Data If possible, configure your HTTP proxy services to check the application layer contents of HTTP CONNECT method tunnels. Even if an HTTP proxy service is not able to decrypt HTTPS data, the proxy service could examine the initial stages of an HTTP CONNECT method connection to confirm that an SSL/TLS handshake is indeed being performed."
