  "Description": "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2017-3217 The CalAmp LMU 3030 series of devices includes an SMS interface on both CDMA and GSM versions of the device. This interface must be password protected, otherwise, the attacker only needs to know the phone number of the device (via an IMSI Catcher, for example) to send administrative commands to the device. These commands can be used to provide ongoing, real-time access to the device and can configure parameters such as IP addresses, firewall rules, and passwords.",
  "ID": "VU#251927",
  "IDNumber": "251927",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The devices provide vehicle tracking via GPS coordinates, heading, and speed, as well as maintenance information. Older versions of the firmware could be remotely updated with malicious code that could affect the CAN bus of the vehicle.",

  "Overview": "OBD-II devices are used to provide telematics information for managers of fleets of vehicles. One type of device, manufactured by CalAmp, has an SMS (text message) interface. We have found multiple deployments where no password was configured for this interface by the integrator / reseller. Companies using the CalAmp hardware should be aware that they need to set a password or disable SMS. Vendors were notified and the SMS interface was disabled or password-protected by all vendors known to be affected.",
  "References": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html",
  "Resolution": "Configure SMS password Vendors that were known to be affected have been contacted and have password-protected or disabled the SMS interface. Other vendors that use the CalAmp LMU-3030 in their system should do the same. Update device firmware We recommend upgrading to the latest firmware from CalAmp in order to provide \u201cdefense in depth\u201d. These devices can have complex supply chains so the reseller may need to work with a service provider or systems integrator to make these changes.",
