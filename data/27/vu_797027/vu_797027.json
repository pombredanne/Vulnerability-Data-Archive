  "Overview": "OpenSSH is an implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It can be configured to use Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for added authentication. A vulnerability exists in OpenSSH, and perhaps other implementations of SSH, which can allow to potentially bypass PAM restrictions.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access to the SSH service You may wish to disable the SSH access until a patch is available from your vendor. If you cannot disable the service, you can limit your exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a router or firewall to restrict access to port 22/TCP (SSH). Implement a TCPWRAPPER."
