  "Description": "The ldd(1) command (list dynamically loaded object dependencies)\ndetermines the appropriate information by executing the file in\nquestion with the following environment variable entry\n\"LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=placeholder\".  Normally this causes the\ndynamic loader bootstrap code which has been bound into the executable\nat link time to display the dynamic library information instead of\nexecuting the program proper.\n\nThis behavior is unfortunate since this command is likely to be\ntypically used to determine information about programs whose pedigree\nis uncertain.",
