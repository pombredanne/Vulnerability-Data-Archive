  "Impact": "Remote users scanning for a dgld service running port on port 5232 may be able to identify victim sites running IRIX.",
  "Keywords": [
    "SGI IRIX",
    "dgld",

  "Overview": "Attackers are using the presence of the dgld service to identify SGI IRIX systems.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC does not believe that there is a vulnerability in dgld. However, sites that do not use dgld should disable it on IRIX hosts to avoid exposing information about the nature of such hosts.",
