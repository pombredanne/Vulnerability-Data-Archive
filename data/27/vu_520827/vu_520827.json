  "Description": "According to PHP's website, \"PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.\" When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution. An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code of index.php is below: http://localhost/index.php?-s Additional information can be found in the vulnerability reporter's blog post.",
  "ID": "VU#520827",
  "IDNumber": "520827",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.",

  "Overview": "PHP-CGI-based setups contain a vulnerability when parsing query string parameters from php files.",

  "Resolution": "Apply update PHP has released version 5.4.3 and 5.3.13 to address this vulnerability. PHP is recommending that users upgrade to the latest version of PHP. PHP has stated, PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use $* instead of \"$@\" to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of issues.",

  "Workarounds": "Apply mod_rewrite rule PHP has stated an alternative is to configure your web server to not let these types of requests with query strings starting with a \"-\" and not containing a \"=\" through. Adding a rule like this should not break any sites. For Apache using mod_rewrite it would look like this: RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$\n    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\\- [NC]\n    RewriteRule .? - [F,L]"
