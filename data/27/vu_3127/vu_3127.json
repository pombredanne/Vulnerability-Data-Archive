  "Description": "                    The Telecom Security Group\n                     http://www.ttsg.com/TTSG/\n\n\n\t\t** TTSG VULNERABILITY ADVISORY **\n\n\nSummary:\n\nDate:\t\t\tJuly 20, 1998\nSubject:\t\tN-Base vulnerability\nContact Address:\tnbase@ttsg.com\nResult:\t\t\tComprimise security of switch, or render\n\t\t\t\tinoperable\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntroduction :\n\n  I have been trying to get N Base to acknowledge that there's a problem since\nApril. The original advisory was sent on May 19th, and a followup advisory was\nsent on July 4th.  They didn't even bother responding. People should feel\nfree to contact me for more information or verification.\n\n  N Base products are also OEM'd to DEC, Allied Telesyn, Lantronix, Intel,\nand Black Box (and presumably others). Some of these companies no longer use\nN Base gear, but may have sold products in the past that are affected. The\nonly way to find out if a given OEM box is really an affected N Base unit is\nto try one of the exploits. The <any username>/forgot is probably the best\ntest.\n\n  All I's are the author.\n===========================================================================\n  Advisory of May 19th, 1998:\n\n  A number of security problems exist in various N Base products. It is quite\nlikely that these problems are also present in OEM versions of N Base products\nsold by others. Because of this, this advisory is CC'd to companies that I be-\nlive are currently distributing N Base products (or have distributed N Base\nproducts in the past), as well as to various computer security response teams.\n\n  I spent a substantial amount of time over the past months trying to get N\nBase to resolve these (and other) problems, as I would have preferred to have\nfixes available before making these announcements. However, I am told that\nN Base has discussed these problems \"at the highest levels\" and has made a\nconscious decision to not correct them. I also stated I would send this notice\non Monday, May 18th, and gave N Base several weeks notice.\n\n  Problem 1: \n\n  Many (all?) N Base managed products have \"back door\" passwords which cannot\nbe disabled. These apply to both the serial console port and the telnet con-\nsole port (if enabled). The username/password combinations are:\n\n  Username\tPassword\n  <any>\t\tforgot\n  <any>\t\tdebug\n\n  Both of these combinations grant full access to the switch - in particular,\nany of the switch parameters can be changed, including the password. Further,\nthe \"debug\" password allows reading of various internal registers. Issuing\nsome debug commands can cause the switch to lock up, requiring a complete\npower cycle to reset. Lastly, with these passwords it is possible to overwrite\nthe switch operational software, leaving the switch in an unbootable mode. \nDepending on the switch model, a return to the factory may be necessary, though\nI have not investigated that.\n\n  This problem has been verified on the NH208, NH215, and NH2016 switches and\nI believe it is present on all managed N Base switches (though I have only\ntested the 3 models listed).\n\n  There is no workaround that does not greatly impact functionality. The most\nsecure workaround is to not define an IP address (disabling IP-based manage-\nment) and to not connect the console serial port. Depending on the environment,\nthis may not be adequate (for example, a switch located in an insecure area\ncan still have its console port tampered with). Other workarounds would be to\nfirewall the network the switch is on to prevent telnet access to the switch.\nOf course, this assumes that a security boundary can be established, which is\nnot always the case.\n\n  To disable the IP functionality, use the set-ip command to set the IP address\nto a random net 10 address, like this: \"set-ip 10.2.3.4\" (do not use 2.3.4, \npick your own random value). Since net 10 is not routed on the Internet and\nis unlikely to be routed on your LAN, this should be safe (the default gate-\nway will remain as originally configured, so any attacks would have to orig-\ninate on an Ethernet segment directly attached to the switch, and picking a\nrandom net 10 address gives a 24-bit \"random\" value that would need to be\nfound in order to attack the switch). We set the switch to a net 10 address\nas it does not seem possible to delete the IP configuration without complete-\nly initializing the switch configuration and losing all other setup values.\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Changing the IP address does not take effect until the switch\nis initialized with the \"warm-reset\" command. I suggest being physically pres-\nent at the switch(es) when you reset them, as 2 of 5 test NH208's hung when I\ntried to reset them.\n\nProblem 2:\n\n  N Base switches that implement a default TFTP server can have the server\noperational software or (possibly) parameters overwritten by anyone who knows\nthe IP address of the switch and has an IP path to the switch.\n\n  N Base switches with a default TFTP server have standard filenames for their\noperational software and parameters. For example, a NH208 uses a software file\nnamed FLASH08.HEX and a parameter file named PARAM08.PAR. The switch will ac-\ncept a TFTP load of any data as long as the file name matches. In the case of\nthe operating software, the currently running software will be erased, the new\nsoftware flashed, and the switch restarted. If the software is not a valid\noperating software for the switch, the switch will appear dead, usually with\nthe FAULT LED illuminated. An unsuspecting user might return the switch to N\nBase for repair, but in any event this will cause substantial inconvenience.\nThe proper operational software can be uploaded to the switch via the serial\nport, assuming that the user has the loader utility and switch software (which\nmay be available from ftp://ftp.nbase.com).\n\n  It may be possible to make similar attacks against the parameter file, which\ncould then be used to compromise VLANs (by removing VLAN partitioning in the\nswitch) or for denial-of-service attacks (by changing ports to incompatible\noperating modes). This has not been verified.\n\n  This problem has been verified on the NH208 and NH215 switches. It is not\npresent on the NH2016 switch unless the switch has been changed to a TFTP\nserver with the \"set-tftp-mode\" command. If your switch has the \"get-tftp-mode\"\ncommand and it reports \"Tftp client will be operate on next software download\"\nthen your switch should not be vulnerable to this problem.\n\n  Workaround: use the \"set-sw-file\" and \"set-par-file\" commands to set the\nfilenames to strings which cannot be easily guessed. IMPORTANT NOTE: It may\nbe possible to read the filenames via the switch MIB. If this is the case,\nthen there is no defense against these attacks other than by disabling IP as\nshown in the statement of Problem 1.\n\n===========================================================================\nAdvisory of July 4th, 1998:\n\n  To date, N Base has not made any substantial effort to integrate a fix for\nthis security hole into the N Base switch product line. Some switch firmware\nhas been released with a useless \"fix\", but other switches have not had a\nnew release, and no discernable effort has been made to inform N Base custom-\ners of this critical security flaw.\n\n  The \"fix\" that N Base has implemented is to simply change the former debug\npassword of \"debug\" to the new debug password of \"debug0\" and the former\nlost password recovery password of \"forgot\" to the new recovery password of\n\"forgotten\".\n\n  N Base should retain a security consultant to explain to them that *any*\nfixed passwords are an *extremely* bad idea, even if \"hidden\" or \"encrypted\"\nin the firmware. This has been true for many years, even before the days of\nDEC's VMS \"FIELD/SERVICE\" account. It was true 2 months ago, when 3Com fixed\na similar problem (with a true fix, not just changing the passwords).\n\n  It *might* be acceptable for these passwords to only work on the serial\nconsole. It depends on the user and the application, and it's not a decision\nI think N Base can make for its customers (at least not without informing\nthem).\n\n  Other products that I am familiar with require either a jumper to be added/\nmoved/removed inside the product, or require the user to contact the vendor\nwith the serial number of the unit in question. The manufacturer then uses an\nalgorithm to compute the maintenance password from the unit serial number.\n\n  Personally, I am in favor of the jumper method. However, I understand that\nit may not be possible to retrofit existing units. It is possible to develop\na solution that does not involve hardware changes - for example, the debug\nand password recovery code could be removed completely from the standard image\nand only include in a special debug-and-recover image. As long as customers\nare informed that the debug-and-recover image is for these purposes only and\nrepresents a security exposure if not replaced with the standard image once\ndebugging and/or password recovery is complete. The debug-and-recover image\ndoesn't need to track other bug fixes, and so could be \"frozen\". This means\nthat there is no additional development overhead - just rename the current\nimages to the debug-and-recover, and omit that capability from future re-\nleases. This assumes that the serial upload functionality is present on all\ncurrent products, of course.\n\n  Lastly, I would add that aside from one contact from N Base saying \"I do\nnot think we have a vulnerability of this nature\", I have received *no* com-\nmunication from N Base regarding my original report.\n\n  If I do not hear from N Base via email by July 20th with a plan for success-\nfully securing these products and notifying affected customers, I will release\nmy original advisory and this update to unrestricted security incident report-\ning lists.\n===========================================================================\nThe Telcom Security Group\nPO Box 69\nNewburgh, NY 12551\n1.800.596.6882\nhttp://www.ttsg.com/TTSG/\n===========================================================================\nCopyright July 1998  The Telcom Security Group\n\nThe information in this document is provided as a service from The Telecom\nSecurity Group (TTSG).
