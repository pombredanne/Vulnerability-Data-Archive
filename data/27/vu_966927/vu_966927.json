  "Description": "According to ZDI's advisory for ZDI-15-363, which has been assigned CVE-2015-7860: \"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Hewlett-Packard Client Automation agent. An attacker can send a large buffer of data to the agent which will cause a stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM.\"\nAccording to ZDI's advisory for ZDI-15-364, which has been assigned CVE-2015-7861: \"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Hewlett-Packard Client Automation agent. An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the agent. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM.\"\nThese vulnerabilities impact the Role-Based Access and Remote Notify features of HP Client Automation. Since 2013, the HP Client Automation software is now developed by Persistent Systems (and its subsidiary Accelerite) under the name Radia Client Automation.",
