  "Description": "",
  "ID": "VU#704976",
  "IDNumber": "704976",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By substituting malicious code for functions called from program libraries, an attacker may execute arbitrary commands within the permissions of the user. This is particularly dangerous for the root account, where the malicious code may grant administrative privilege to the attacker.",
  "Keywords": [
    "LD_RUN_PATH",
    "Ghostscript",
    "gs"
  ],
  "Overview": "Alladin Ghostscript, a previewer for postscript files, uses an insecure value for the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable. This allows attackers to supply malicious libraries to be loaded from the current directory.",
