  "Description": "CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\nVASCO's IDENTIKEY Authentication Server (IAS) is a product which provides two-factor authentication capability. VASCO IDENTIKEY Authentication Server version 3.4.x contains an authentication bypass vulnerability which could allow an attacker to login to a system without needing the user's Active Directory password credentials. The expected behavior of the product is to authenticate a user from a RADIUS client if and only if that user enters a concatenation of his or her Microsoft Active Directory password credentials and a one-time password that is generated by an assigned DIGIPASS security token. The observed behavior is that the user need only enter the one-time password generated by the security token; the product will successfully authenticate the user when no Active Directory password is provided. This reduces two-factor authentication into one-factor authentication (i.e. just the one-time password generated using the security token).",
