  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By supplying a specially crafted PNG image as an email attachment and convincing a user to view the image on a BlackBerry Handheld, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service to the Blackberry Attachment Service. The attacker may be able to take control of a vulnerable system. A denial of service may only affect some users, and the Attachment Service may start new threads immediately or after a specified time period (25 minutes by default).",
