  "Description": "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials DSL routers, including the ASUS DSL-N12E, DIGICOM DG-5524T, Observa Telecom RTA01N, Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) SpeedSurf 504AN and Kasda KW58293, and ZTE ZXV10 W300 contain hard-coded credentials that are useable in the telnet service on the device. In the ASUS, DIGICOM, Observa Telecom, and ZTE devices, the username is \"admin,\" in the PLDT devices, the user name is \"adminpldt,\" and in all affected devices, the password is \"XXXXairocon\" where \"XXXX\" is the last four characters of the device's MAC address. The MAC address may be obtainable over SNMP with community string public. The vulnerability was previously disclosed in VU#228886 and assigned CVE-2014-0329 for ZTE ZXV10 W300, but it was not known at the time that the same vulnerability affected products published by other vendors. The Observa Telecom RTA01N was previously disclosed on the Full Disclosure mailing list.",
