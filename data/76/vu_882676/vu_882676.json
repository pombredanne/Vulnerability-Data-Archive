  "Description": "CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool Some HP Multi-function printers such as the HP Color Laserjet Pro 400 (M475dn) and HP Laserjet Pro CM1415fnw and possibly other models contain a remote denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. The affected models include any of the multi-function printers that support the WS-Discovery protocol. A remote attacker can send UDP packets to port 3702 on either a multicast or unicast IP address that the printer resides on to cause the device to crash. This process can be repeated every 30 to 60 seconds to cause the device to crash repeatedly.",
