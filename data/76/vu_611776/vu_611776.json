  "ID": "VU#611776",
  "IDNumber": "611776",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote intruder could modify DAD and cache settings. By modifying, creating, or deleting DADs, an intruder could gain access to PL/SQL applications or deny service legitimate users. Also, access to the PL/SQL gateway administration web interface exposes two buffer overflow vulnerabilities:  one in the DAD password field [VU#659043] and a second in the cache directory name [VU#923395].",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle 9i Application Server (iAS). In its default configuration, the PL/SQL module grants unauthenticated access to the PL/SQL gateway web-based administration interface.",

  "Resolution": "Restrict Access\nAccess to the PL/SQL gateway administration web pages can be restricted by specifying authorized user names and connect strings or an administrative Database Access Descriptor (DAD) in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. For more information, read the section titled Protecting the Administration pages in the Oracle iAS documentation under Using the PL/SQL Gateway.",

  "Workarounds": "Change Path to Administrative Interface The path to the administration web pages can be configured in the the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. While changing the path may make it more difficult, it does not prevent an intruder from accessing the administration web pages. To protect the administration web pages, configure the PL/SQL gateway to require authentication as noted above under Restrict Access. Disable Vulnerable Service Disable the PL/SQL service (modplsql or mod_plsql in Apache)."
