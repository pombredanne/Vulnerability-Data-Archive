  "Description": "As described in RFC 2131, \"The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.\"  ISC DHCP is a reference implementation of the DHCP protocol, including a DHCP server, client, and relay agent. The ISC DHCP client code (dhclient) contains a stack buffer overflow in the script_write_params() method. dhclient fails to check the length of the server-supplied subnet-mask option before copying it into a buffer. According to ISC, the following versions are affected: DHCP 4.1 (all versions)\nDHCP 4.0 (all versions)\nDHCP 3.1 (all versions)\nDHCP 3.0 (all versions)\nDHCP 2.0 (all versions)",

  "Overview": "The ISC DHCP dhclient application contains a stack buffer overflow, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch or update from your vendor\nFor vendor-specific information regarding vulnerable status and patch availability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. Upgrade your version of DHCP Upgrade your system as specified by your vendor. If you need to upgrade DHCP manually, according to ISC: Upgrade to 4.1.0p1, 4.0.1p1, or 3.1.2p1 There are no fixes planned for DHCP 3.0 or DHCP 2.0, as those release trains have reached End-Of-Life.",
