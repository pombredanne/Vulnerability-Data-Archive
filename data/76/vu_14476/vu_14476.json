  "Description": "Ok so all this does is build a really fraggmented over sized packet\nand once win95 gets it, and puts it back together it locks.  Maybe\nits spending processor time to figure out how to put them back\ntogether?  I've had reports of people blue screening from it\ntho so we'll let Microsoft's boys figure exactly what this does\nto 95.  As of now i haven't tested it on NT, but maybe i will\nlater ;).  All of this source wasn't origonally written by me I\njust took one of the old programs to kill POSIX and SYSV based\nsystems and worked on it abit, then made it spoof =).",

Grr.. Windows NT 3.51: Microsoft Knowledge Base Document\nICMP Patch for NT 3.51 SP5 (Intel) - Requires Service Pack 5\nICMP Patch for NT 3.51 SP5 (Alpha) - Requires Service Pack 5 Windows95: Microsoft Knowledge Base Document\nICMP Patch for Windows 95 Oddly enough, I've gotten many reports that Microsofts patch does not\nalways work. You are encouraged to try the test yourself page on here\nafter you patch up. Unofficial Windows95 Patch: Days before the official fix, Phrozen Crew, a well known \"Cracking\nGroup\" has released what seems to be a Windows95 (not Memphis or\nNT) patch. Download pingfix.zip (read this README.TXT about it\nfirst!) into your C:\\Windows\\System and then run it. Try the test\nyourself! page to see if you immune. If this patch fails to work,\nyou can try the next one. If that doesn't work: (especially for Memphis users)\nAnother patch, which is probably what the above patch really does,\nis to hexedit c:\\windows\\system\\vip.386 and change the hex string\n76D2 to 4840, then reboot. This patch is for people who the above\npatch does not work on (Memphis, strange Win95 versions like the\nbeta dialer). It has not been tested on NT yet. If you do not know\nwhat a Hex Editor is, you probabl ydo not want to attempt it. (Thanks to voltage for passing this information to me)"
