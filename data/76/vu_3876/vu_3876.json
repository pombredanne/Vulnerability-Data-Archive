  "Description": "First, some brief background:  A NIS master server has to update its slave\nservers whenever one of its maps changes; to do this, it calls them with\nthe YPPROC_XFR RPC, and tells them which map needs updating.  Each slave\nthen runs ypxfr(8) which downloads the map from the master, and tells the\noriginal caller that this slave server has now synchronized its maps with\nthe master's.",
