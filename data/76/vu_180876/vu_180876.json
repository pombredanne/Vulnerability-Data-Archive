  "Resolution": "Use SSL Proficy Portal version 2.5 and up supports the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections between the client and server. The SSL protocol is commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services via public/private keys and certificates. Proficy customers should refer to GE Fanuc knowledge base article KB12459 for more information and configuration instructions. Enable Integrated Windows Authentication It is possible to configure the portal to use domain authentication so that user credentials are not longer sent in plaintext. According to GE Fanuc: If domain security is being utilized, the easiest and perhaps most secure method of transmitting username and password information is to enable Windows Authentication within IIS. In this mode, IE and IIS will negotiate the security mechanism's to use and automatically authenticate the user logged into the machine running IE from the IIS server. No password is ever passed between the two computers and therefore cannot be intercepted. Proficy customers should refer to GE Fanuc knowledge base article KB12459 and the Microsoft documents in the References section below for more information.",
