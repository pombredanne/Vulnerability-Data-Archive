  "Workarounds": "Clear browser caches Clearing browser caches frequently may mitigate this vulnerability by deleting data that was inadvertantly cached. In Internet Explorer 7, click on Tools, Internet Options, Delete (under the Browsing history section), then Delete all. For Firefox 2 and 3 see the Firefox Options window support page for information on how to automatically remove cached browser files. In Safari 3.0, click Safari then Reset Safari.
