  "Description": "Cron creates a temp file in /tmp.  It later re-reads this file by\nre-opening it rather than seeking to the beginning of the open file\ndescriptor.  Cracker can replace the file with a symlink.  When\ncron reads the new file, it does so as root which the user could\nnot have done.  \"Errors\" in the file (anything that doesn't look\nlike a cron line) are reported to the user.",
