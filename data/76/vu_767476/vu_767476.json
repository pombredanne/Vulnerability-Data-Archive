  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the permissions of the Client Service for Netware, specifically LocalSystem. Microsoft states that for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 the attacker would need to be authenticated with valid user logon credentials in order to successfully carry out an attack on an affected system. On other affected platforms, the attacker would not need to be authenticated.",
