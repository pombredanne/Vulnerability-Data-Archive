  "Description": "NCSA HTTPD and Apache come with a PERL subroutine that is\nintended to provide cgi-bin scripts with protection against\nmisuse by attackers by eliding certain dangerous characters.\nBut it misses some bad characters that can be exploited.\nIn particular, one of the sample applications distributed with\nthese programs includes this routine and can be exploited.\n\nFrom svh - An additional aspect the 'phf' vulnerability occurs to me: there\ndoesn't seem to be anything preventing an intruder from overwriting a)\nthe log files for the web server, or b) the config files for the web\nserver. If he can overwrite the log files, he can cover his tracks. If\nhe can overwrite the config files, he can configure the web server to\nstart as root next time, cause it or wait for it to restart, and\nbecome root through the same vul.\n\nThis is all implied by the nature of the vul, but I just wanted to get\nthis captured.",
