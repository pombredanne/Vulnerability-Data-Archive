  "Description": "Comcast cable modem gateway devices, including the ARRIS TG862G/CT Xfinity Gateway (XB2) and Cisco XB3/BWG, contain multiple vulnerabilities. Undocumented account The undocumented credentials cusadmin:Xfinity may be used to authenticate to the Web User Interface (WebUI). Hidden services There are two distinct WebUI portals on the LAN, including one intended for ISP administrative use that contains additional configuration options. The cusadmin account may permit a LAN-based attacker to access the additional configuration settings, such as enabling telnet and ssh for remote root shell access to the device. The web admin pages may also be used to obtain the SSID and password for a hidden WiFi network ARRIS password-of-the-day backdoor The TG862G/CT also makes use of the previously described Arris password-of-the-day mechanism, though it should be noted that the prerequisite ssh service is disabled by default. Refer to VU#419568 for more information.",
