  "Description": "Openfire 3.9.1, and possibly earlier versions, contains an uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) vulnerability when using XMPP DEFLATE message compression. It has been reported that a highly compressed XMPP message of 4MB that uncompresses to 4GB may cause a resource exhaustion denial of service. The highly compressed XMPP messages may be sent in parallel to enhance the denial of service.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Network Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks if possible. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from connecting to the service from a blocked network location. Disable XMPP Compression Navigate to the menu Server -> Server Settings -> Compression Settings -> Client Compression Policy and check the option Not Available - Clients will not receive the option to use compressed traffic."
