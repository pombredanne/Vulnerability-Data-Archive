  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Until updates can be applied, creating a firewall rule to restrict access to 5353/udp and 1900/udp may mitigate this vulnerability. See the Apple Support document Creating an Advanced IP Firewall Rule for more information on how to create firewall rules. Note that blocking these ports may cause applications that rely on Bonjour to fail."
