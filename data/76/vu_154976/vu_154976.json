  "Impact": "The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. In the worst case, it could allow an intruder to execute code with root privileges, but that impact is unconfirmed. Because the overflow occurs in a buffer used to hold argv[0], an intruder cannot use this flaw to crash an existing snmpd.",

  "Overview": "The SNMP proxy agent on certain large Solaris systems contains a buffer overflow. It may be possible, though it is unconfirmed, that an intruder could use this flaw to execute code with root privileges.",
