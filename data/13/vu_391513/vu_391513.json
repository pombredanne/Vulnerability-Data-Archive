  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause any vulnerable device within range to deauthenticate, deassociate, or lose data, resulting in a denial of service.",

  "Overview": "The IEEE 802.11 protocol does not provide adequately secure authentication for management frames. An attacker could spoof management frames and cause a denial of service to any network within radio range.",
  "References": "www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/savage/papers/UsenixSec03.pdf ",
  "Resolution": "A complete solution is not available for 802.11 devices. Several ideas have been proposed, but implementation would require changes to the protocol specification and possibly also hardware replacement.",

  "Workarounds": "Cryptographically authenticate 802.11 management frames As noted in the paper referenced above:  \"The deauthentication [and deassociation and power saving] vulnerability can be solved directly by explicitly authenticating management frames and dropping invalid requests.\" requires hardware capable of doing crypto quickly, ie new hardware work underway, cite MS doc or IEEE or other Check for traffic after de-authentication or de-association Another potential solution would not require significant hardware replacement. Citing the paper again: In particular, by delaying the effects of deauthentication or disassociation requests (e.g., by queuing such requests for 5-10 seconds) an AP has the opportunity to observe subsequent packets from the client. If a data packet arrives after a deauthentication or disassociation request is queued, that request is discarded since a legitimate client would never generate packets in that order. This solution would require firmware upgrades and most likely a change to the 802.11 standard. In addition, this solution creates a new timing vulnerablity when a node changes associations between access points."
