  "Description": "From  Repent Security Incorporated Advisory RSI.0007.05-26-98.SUN.LIBAUTH\n\n Two buffer overflows exist in Sun Microsystem's libauth library.\n \nWhen ia_open_session () is called, it copies both the\nconnecting hostname and username into seperate local \nbuffers with no bounds checking.  ia_open_session ()\nattempts to write the information passed to it into these\nbuffers to maintain utmpx information on the user logging\ninto the system.  Because these buffers are set at a fixed\nvalue of 257 bytes, it is possible to cause a buffer\noverflow.\n \nWhile overwriting the buffer, the attacker can manipulate\nthe stack and execute their own commands, possibly gaining\nroot access on the system.",
