  "ID": "VU#464113",
  "IDNumber": "464113",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker may be able to establish connections with hosts behind firewalls in violation of implied security policies. As a result, an attacker can send data to hosts and services that he ordinarily cannot reach. An intruder could also leverage this flaw to exploit a vulnerability in passive software listening promiscuously on the inside of the firewall (e.g., vulnerability in tcpdump or some similar vulnerability). Note that the specific kinds of packets that may bypass a firewall are highly dependent on the implementation of the firewall.",

  "Overview": "Various vendors' TCP/IP implementations handle packets containing unusual flag combinations in different ways, which may lead to a violation of implicit or explicit security policies.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a vendor patch. If a vendor patch is not available for your TCP implementation (and even if one is), you may wish to: create filtering rules designed to drop and/or reject packets with certain combinations of bits set in initial synchronization packets\nnot use routable IP space except inside your DMZ\nif possible, switch to stateful filtering; however, you shouldn't do this unless you know your network traffic well enough to be sure that it has the required properties (symmetric routing, not too many flows, not too much idle time per flow)",
