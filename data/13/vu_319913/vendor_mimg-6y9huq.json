It is important to note that there have been no reports of compromise due to this vulnerability. Aruba Networks' primary concern in this instance is to rapidly deploy a solution for our entire customer base. As a result, Aruba has released patches for the most prevalent code versions. We highly recommend that you upgrade your Mobility Controller to a patch corresponding to your currently installed release. While we encourage customers to always utilize the latest releases to ensure the full benefit of our continued innovation and improvements, we recognize that this is not always possible. Therefore, all releases of code incorporating this fix are immediately available for download at https://support.arubanetworks.com If you do not have an ArubaCare contract, you should contact your local reseller for assistance."
