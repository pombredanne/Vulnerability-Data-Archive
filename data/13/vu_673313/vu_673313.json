  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Google Search Appliance versions earlier than 7.2.0.G.114 and 7.0.14.G.216 fail to properly sanitize user input that is reflected directly into a JavaScript <script> block if the dynamic navigation feature is enabled. This allows an attacker to perform a reflected XSS attack.",
