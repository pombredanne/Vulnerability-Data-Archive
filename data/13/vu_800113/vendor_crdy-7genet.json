  "VendorStatement": "MaraDNS uses a secure random number generator to generate both the query\nID and the port to bind to. In more detail, MaraDNS uses information from\nthe file /dev/urandom as a random seed to generate a cryptographic key. Using a variant of AES, MaraDNS has 16 bits of entropy for the query ID\nand 12 bits of entropy for the source port. Deadwood, a from-the-ground-up reimplementation of MaraDNS also uses a secure\nrandom number generator. Instead of using an AES variant, Deadwood uses a\nstream cipher called \"Radio Gatun\" (a derivative of Panama) as the random\nnumber generator. Note that the Windows port, if improperly configured, will have possible\nsecurity issues because there is not a convenient pool of random numbers\non that platform. So, in summary, I am aware of this security problem and have gone to some\neffort make sure MaraDNS (and Deadwood) does not have this issue."
