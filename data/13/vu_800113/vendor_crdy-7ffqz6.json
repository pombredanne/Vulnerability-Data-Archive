  "VendorStatement": "PowerDNS Vendor Statement Since version 3.0, released in April 2006, the PowerDNS Recursor resolving\nnameserver has implemented measures that protect against the vulnerability\ndescribed in CVE-2008-1447. Source ports are randomized, and 'near misses',\nindicating a spoofing attempt in progress, are detected, and the query is\ndropped. Although all 3.x versions implement these measures, from 3.1.6 a\ncryptographically secure random generator is used which further enhances\nprotection against spoofing, so an upgrade to 3.1.6 or higher is advised."
