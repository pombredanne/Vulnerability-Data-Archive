  "Revision": 3,
  "Status": "Not Vulnerable",
  "Vendor": "NLnet Labs",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "MIMG-7EMJVA",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "Unbound implements numerous strategies to prevent spoof protection,\nthose include udp port randomization,  rtt banding, source ip\nrandomization, and optionally, so called 0x20 query name randomization. Besides, Unbound features an architectural element that performs sanity\nchecks on incoming data to prevent certain types of poisoning attempts. Although Unbound has been built using all known protections against DNS\nspoofs, the DNS protocol is inherently vulnerable to these sorts of\nattacks. NLnet Labs believes that the only real solution to this problem\nis the use of DNSSEC."
