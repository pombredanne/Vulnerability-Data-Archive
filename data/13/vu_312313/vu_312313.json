  "Workarounds": "Ingress Filtering - It may be possible to limit the scope of this vulnerability by applying ingress filtering (blocking access to TCP port 7100 at your network perimeter). Note: You should carefully consider the impact of blocking services that you may be using. Disable XFS Service - To disable the XFS Service, comment out the following line in /etc/inetd.conf (remember to restart inetd after making this change) fs              stream  tcp     wait nobody /usr/openwin/lib/fs.auto    fs"
