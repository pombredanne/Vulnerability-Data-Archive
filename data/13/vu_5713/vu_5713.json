  "Description": "When an account is created on an NT domain with an Exchange 5.0\nserver with POP3 service, it is possible to change the password for\nthis account.  This is of course desirable behaviour.\n\nHowever, if the password is changed, the POP3 client is able to use\n_either_ the new or old password to log in.  It appears that the\nold password is cached, and the old value is not cleared from the\ncache with the update.",
  "ID": "VU#5713",
  "IDNumber": "5713",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Old passwords are not expired properly, thus allowing several\npasswords to be used to log into one account.",
