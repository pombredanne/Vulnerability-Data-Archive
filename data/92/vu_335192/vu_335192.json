  "Description": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - CVE-2015-2904 Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem contains multiple hard-coded credentials that enable a user to log into the web administration interface with root privileges. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-2905 Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem contains a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. Note that in combination with hard-coded credentials, an attacker can reliably establish an active session as part of an attack and therefore does not require a victim to be logged in. The CVSS score below describes CVE-2015-2904.",

  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session or perform actions as an authenticated user. A network-based attacker can take complete control of an affected device.",
