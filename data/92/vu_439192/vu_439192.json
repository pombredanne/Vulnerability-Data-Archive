  "Description": "According to Control Microsystems ClearSCADA's website: \"ClearSCADA is an integrated SCADA host platform that includes a polling engine, real-time database, historian, web server, alarm redirection for text messaging and email and a reporting package.\" According to ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-10-314-01A, there are three vulnerabilities in ClearSCADA: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the ClearSCADA application. The overflow identified is a \u201cuse after free\u201d type heap overflow. Reliable heap corruption was discovered by sending overly long strings following a valid packet. This heap overflow can cause a denial of service condition for the ClearSCADA application, or it could be leveraged for remote code execution. ClearSCADA provides a web interface that supports both HTTP (plain-text) and HTTPS (encrypted) for remote connections. By default, the ClearSCADA server uses HTTP; this allows anyone with access to the connection between the client and server to view authentication credentials in plain text (unsecure). The web interface is vulnerable to reflective (nonpersistent) cross-site scripting. Using this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code directly into the user's browsing session. Parameters are passed back to the user without being properly sanitized. Note: This Advisory also applies to all versions of SCX (from Serck UK or Serck Aus) that are older than the following (these SCX versions bundle ClearSCADA in the package): SCX Version 67 R4.5\nSCX Version 68 R3.9.",
