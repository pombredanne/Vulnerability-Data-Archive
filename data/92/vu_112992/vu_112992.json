  "Description": "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data - CVE-2017-9805 In Apache Struts 2 framework, versions 2.5 to 2.5.12, the REST plugin uses XStreamHandler with an instance of XStream to deserialize XML data. Because there is no type filtering, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may send a specially crafted XML payload to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Struts application. Refer to the researcher's blog post for more information about this vulnerability. A Metasploit module with exploit code is publicly available.",
