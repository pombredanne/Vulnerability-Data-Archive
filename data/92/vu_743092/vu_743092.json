  "Overview": "A function originally derived from 4.4BSD, realpath(3), contains a vulnerability that may permit a malicious user to gain root access to the server. This function was derived from the FreeBSD 3.x tree. Other applications and operating systems that use or were derived from this code base may be affected. This problem was originally reported to affect WU-FTPd. It has been discoved to affect various BSD implementations as well.",
