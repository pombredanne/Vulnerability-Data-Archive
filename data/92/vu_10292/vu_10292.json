  "Description": "A major security problem has bee found in svgalib, and exploits are\navailable which work through the zgv image viewer. This problem\naffects all releases of Red Hat Linux on Intel platforms.

All of the updated packages have been been\nsigned with Red Hat's PGP key.\n\nThanks once again to the readers of the BUGTRAQ mailing list for\nproviding details on this problem.",
