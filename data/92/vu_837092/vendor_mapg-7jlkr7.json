  "Addendum": "This issue is addressed with the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which comes with agent.exe version 11.1.100.17104. This version of FLEXnet Connect includes the ability to verify certificates that are provided by the FLEXnet Connect server. A FLEXnet Connect server that uses signed communication will add an X-FNC-Sig HTTP header to outgoing messages. This signature is designed to prevent the server response from being successfully modified by an attacker. The signature checking is also designed to ensure that the FLEXnet Connect client is connecting to an authentic FLEXnet Connect server, much in the same way that HTTPS helps to ensure the identity of a web site. Note that the originally-released version of the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which came with agent.exe version 11.1.100.16604, did not completely address this vulnerability. Note that the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 SDK does not enable secure communications by default, but the updates.installshield.com FLEXnet Connect server is currently distributing an update that enables this feature. This means that if a system's DNS has been hijacked or if the communications with the FLEXnet Connect update server are modified before this update can be retrieved, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system. Because the fixed version of the FLEXnet Connect runtime is relatively new (it was digitally signed on September 26, 2008), it is likely to take some time before software that is packaged with FLEXnet Connect will receive the update and also configure FLEXnet Connect to verify signatures.",
