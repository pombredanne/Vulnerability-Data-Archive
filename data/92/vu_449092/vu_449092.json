  "Workarounds": "Until it is possible to upgrade to AOL Nullsoft Winamp version 3.51, the following workarounds will help reduce the chances of exploitation: Disable Winamp playlist file association Disable the file association for Winamp playlist files to help prevent Windows applications from using Winamp to open playlists. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Winamp.Playlist\nDisable Shoutcast and Ultravox protocols Links to malicious playlist files may be accessed using the Shoutcast (shout:) or Ultravox (uvox:) protocols. Disabling these protocols will reduce the chances of exploitation. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ICY\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\SC\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\SHOUT\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\UVOX\nDo not open Winamp playlist files Do not open Winamp playlist files (.PLS or .M3U) from untrusted sources."
