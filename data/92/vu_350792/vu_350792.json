  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d. In many cases, this system also operates a KDC, so this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain the master secret for a Kerberos realm, leading to compromise of the entire realm. An attacker may also be able to crash a system running krb524d, causing a denial of service.",

  "Overview": "The MIT Kerberos krb524d daemon does not securely deallocate heap memory when handling an error condition, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d, which in many cases is also a Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC). The compromise of a KDC system can lead to the compromise of an entire Kerberos realm. An attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service on a system running krb524d.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Depending on network architecture, it may be practical to restrict access to systems running krb524d (4444/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. While this will help to limit the source of attacks, it will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses."
