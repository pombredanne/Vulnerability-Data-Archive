  "Addendum": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS BGP Attribute Corruption Vulnerability Revision 1.0 For Public Release 2001 May 10 08:00 AM US/Pacific (UTC -0700) Summary A Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) UPDATE contains Network Layer\nReachability  Information (NLRI) and attributes that describe the path to\nthe destination. An unrecognized transitive attribute can cause failures in\nCisco IOS routers, ranging from a crash upon receipt of the unrecognized\ntransitive attribute, to a later failure upon attempt to clear the\nunrecognized transitive attribute. Specific but common configurations are\naffected, and described below. The failure was discovered  because of a\nmalfunction in the BGP implementation of another vendor. There is no\nworkaround. Affected customers are urged to upgrade to fixed code. This vulnerability has been assigned Cisco bug ID CSCdt79947. The complete text of this advisory will be located at\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ios-bgp-attr-corruption-pub.shtml Affected Products Configurations including  BGP4 Prefix Filtering with Inbound Route Maps are\nvulnerable. BGP with prefix or inbound routemap filtering was introduced\nin Cisco IOS\u00ae Software version 11.2  The following versions of Cisco IOS\nSoftware are affected and listed in the table below: 11.CC and its\nderivatives, 11.2 and its  derivaties, 11.3, 11.3T, 12.0, 12.0S and special\nbranches taken out of 12.0 are all affected. The versions of Cisco IOS\nSoftware based on 12.1, 12.0(5)T, 12.2, 12.0ST, and 12.1(E) are not\naffected. The following products are affected if they run a Cisco IOS\nsoftware release that has the defect. To determine if a Cisco product is\nrunning an affected IOS, log in to the device and issue the show version\ncommand. Cisco IOS software will identify itself as \"Internetwork Operating\nSystem Software\" or \"IOS (tm)\" software and will display a version number. Other Cisco devices either will not have the show version command, or will\ngive different output. Compare the version number obtained from the router\nwith the versions presented in the Software Versions and Fixes section\nbelow. Cisco devices that may be running with affected Cisco IOS software releases\ninclude: * Cisco routers in the AGS/MGS/CGS/AGS+, IGS, RSM, 800, ubr900, 1000,\n     1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 2500, 2600, 3000, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4500,\n     4700, AS5200, AS5300, AS5800, 6400, 7000, 7200, ubr7200, 7500, and\n     12000 series. Cisco devices that may be running Cisco IOS Software, but do NOT support\nBGP and are therefore not vulnerable include: * Most recent versions of the LS1010 ATM switch. * The Catalyst 2900XL LAN switch only if it is running IOS. * The Catalyst 1900, 2800, 2900, 3000, and 5000 series LAN switches. * The Cisco DistributedDirector. If you are not running Cisco IOS software, you are not affected by this\nvulnerability. If you are not running BGP, you are not affected by this\nvulnerability. Cisco products that do not run Cisco IOS software and are not affected by\nthis defect include, but are not limited to: * 700 series dialup routers (750, 760, and 770 series) are not affected. * The Catalyst 6000 is not affected if it is not running IOS. * WAN switching products in the IGX and BPX lines are not affected. * The MGX (formerly known as the AXIS shelf) is not affected. * No host-based software is affected. * The Cisco PIX Firewall is not affected. * The Cisco LocalDirector is not affected. * The Cisco Cache Engine is not affected. Details A Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) UPDATE contains Network Layer Reachability\nInformation (NLRI) and attributes that describe the path to the\ndestination. Each path attribute is a type, length, value (TLV) object. This failure occurs as a result of memory corruption and only in\nconfigurations using specific inbound route filtering. The failure was\ndiscovered because of a malfunction in the BGP implementation of another\nvendor. There is no workaround. Impact The vulnerability can be exercised repeatedly, affecting core routers,\ncreating widespread network outages. This vulnerability can only be\nexercised in configurations that include both BGP and inbound route\nfiltering on affected software. Software Versions and Fixes The following table summarizes the Cisco IOS software releases that are\nknown to be affected, and the earliest estimated dates of availability for\nthe recommended fixed versions. Dates are always tentative and subject to\nchange. Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or\nproducts for which it is intended. If a given release train is vulnerable,\nthen the earliest possible releases that contain the fix and the\nanticipated date of availability for each are listed in the \"Rebuild\",\n\"Interim\", and \"Maintenance\" columns. A device running any release in the\ngiven train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less\nthan the earliest fixed release) is known to be vulnerable, and it should\nbe upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later version (greater\nthan the earliest fixed release label). When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions: Maintenance\n          Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any label\n          in a given row of the table. Rebuild\n          Constructed from the previous maintenance or major release in the\n          same train, it contains the fix for a specific defect. Although\n          it receives less testing, it contains only the minimal changes\n          necessary to effect the repair. Interim\n          Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases and\n          receive less testing. Interims should be selected only if there\n          is no other suitable release that addresses the vulnerability,\n          and interim images should be upgraded to the next available\n          maintenance release as soon as possible. Interim releases are not\n          available via manufacturing, and usually they are not available\n          for customer download from CCO without prior arrangement with the\n          Cisco TAC. In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices\nto be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and\nsoftware configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new\nrelease. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco TAC for\nassistance as shown later in this notice.
