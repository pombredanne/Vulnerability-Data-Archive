  "Overview": "There is a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Windows Messenger service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on most recent versions of Microsoft Windows.",
  "References": [
    "http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp",
    "http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=828035"
  ],
  "Resolution": "Disable the Windows messenger service and evaluate the need to apply the patch. To disable the Messenger service, follow these steps as provided by Microsoft: Click Start , and then click Control Panel (or point to Settings , and then click Control Panel ). Double-click Administrative Tools . Double-click Services . Double-click Messenger . In the Startup type list, click Disabled . Click Stop , and then click OK . Impact of Workaround: If the Messenger service is disabled, messages from the Alerter service (for example notifications from your backup software or Uninterruptible Power Supply) are not transmitted. If the Messenger service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Messenger service do not start, and an error message is logged in the System event log. The image below illustrates this procedure on Microsoft Windows XP. It will appear different on different versions of Windows. You should carefully consider the impact of disabling the Messenger service.",
