  "Description": "Wireshark is a protocol analyzer that can open or import previously saved files. When processing an Endace ERF file an unsigned integer wrap vulnerability may cause Wireshark to allocate a very large buffer. To exploit this issue, an attacker would have to convince a user to open a crafted ERF file using Wireshark. This issue also affects Tshark, the console version of Wireshark.",
  "ID": "VU#676492",
  "IDNumber": "676492",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause Wireshark to crash. It may be possible, although unlikely, for an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Exploiting the vulnerability could result in a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to code execution on certain platforms.",
