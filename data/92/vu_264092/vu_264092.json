  "Description": "CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation - CVE-2015-2859 McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) supports integration with external registered servers for a variety of purposes, such as data collection and aggregation. Optionally, ePO can be configured to use SSL/TLS to encrypt communications with registered servers. McAfee ePO fails to verify the signing certificate authority (CA) as well as the common name (CN) or domain name (DN) listed in a certificate. Consequently, these communication links are susceptible to man-in-the-middle interception and spoofing attacks. For more information, refer to McAfee's security bulletin SB10120.",
  "ID": "VU#264092",
  "IDNumber": "264092",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can intercept and manipulate HTTPS traffic between the ePO application and registered servers.",
