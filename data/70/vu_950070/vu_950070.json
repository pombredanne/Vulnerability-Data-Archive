Install the patch from: ftp://ftpna.beasys.com/pub/releases/security/CR171885_810sp2.jar WebLogic Server version 8.1 Service Pack 3 will include the functionality in this patch. You can also examine any weblogic.xml file that has been edited by WebLogic Builder and re-enter any <security-role-assignment> tags that have been deleted. WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 7.0 Any weblogic.xml file that has been edited by Weblogic Builder must be examined to ensure that all of the desired <security-role-assignment> tags are still in the file. To prevent this problem in the future: 1. Upgrade to WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 7.0 Service Pack 5. 2. Install the patch from: ftp://ftpna.beasys.com/pub/releases/security/CR171885_70sp5.jar WebLogic Server version 7.0 Service Pack 6 will include the functionality in this patch.
