  "Description": "There exists at least one vulnerability in the Xt library caused by\na buffer overrun that allows arbitrary code to be executed. This\nvulnerability exists in the Xt library itself. As such all programs\nlinked with it that are suid root or can be coerced into running as\nroot are vulnerable.  The standard example is of curse suid\nxterm. The vulnerability has been confirmed under FreeBSD, Solaris,\nand as far as we can tell every single other OS running all\nrevisions of X11.\n\nThere exists a large number of places in the Xt library code where\nbuffers allocated on the stack are handled insecurly other than the\none used on the fallowing exploit. The Xt library is a can of\nworms.\n\nThe original author of this vulnerability is \"b0z0 bra1n\".",
