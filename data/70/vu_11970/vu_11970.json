  "Description": "The underlying cause of the problem is that in chk_strings.pl,\nanything inside backticks is evaluated to do a better job of scanning\nthe file.  The trouble is that this code is used to scan files that can\nbe created by untrusted users.  In particular, it is used in the cron.chk\nsection to check user's crontabs.",

  "Workarounds": "One solution to the problem is to ignore anything that has backticks\nin it. Another method is to replace the backticks and anything between them\nwith a *, then glob on the resulting string. This plugs the hole, and also\nallows you to check any file that could possibly be referenced by the\nbackticked version of the string. see mail message for patch"
