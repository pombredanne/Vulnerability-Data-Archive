  "Description": "Symantec Security Advisory SYM12-007 states: Overview\nVersions of Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager 11.0 running the Network Threat Protection module on Windows Server 2003 are susceptible to a Denial of Service(DoS). Successful exploitation could potentially result in the system hosting Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager becoming unresponsive to IIS-based web server requests until restarted. Details\nSymantec was notified of a Denial of Service(DoS) within the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager 11 RU6 and related maintenance packs. A successful exploitation is possible when using audit tools to aggressively scan the targeted Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager host. After a period of heavy scanning the Network Threat Protection  module responds to the perceived threat by blocking all subsequent traffic to the server. This can lead the server to stop serving pages and in some instances can cause excessive resource use which can lead to a hang or crash of the server. This issue does not impact the security of the Symantec Endpoint Manager, only the availability of the web server components. It has been reported that this vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0, however newer versions could be affected.",
