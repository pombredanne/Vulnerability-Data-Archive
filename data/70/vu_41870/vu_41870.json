  "Workarounds": "Configure sadmind to use AUTH_DES authentication As recommended by Sun Alert 56740, users can take the following steps to enable AUTH_DES authentication: 1. Edit the \"/etc/inetd.conf\" file and append \"-S 2\" to the end of the sadmind line as follows: 100232/10   tli   rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind    sadmind -S 2 2. Tell the inetd(1M) process to reread the newly modified \"/etc/inetd.conf\" file by sending it a hangup signal, SIGHUP: # /usr/bin/pkill -HUP inetd Disable the sadmind daemon As recommended by Sun Alert 56740, users can take the following steps to disable sadmind: 1. Edit the \"/etc/inetd.conf\" file and comment out the following line by adding the \"#\" symbol to the beginning of the line as follows: #100232/10   tli   rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind    sadmind 2. Tell the inetd(1M) process to reread the newly modified \"/etc/inetd.conf\" file by sending it a hangup signal, SIGHUP: # /usr/bin/pkill -HUP inetd"
