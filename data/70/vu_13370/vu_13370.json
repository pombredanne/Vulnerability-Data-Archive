  "Description": "Description from Cisco's public bulletin:\n\nSome Cisco 7xx routers can be crashed by connecting with TELNET and\ntyping very long password strings. There exists a possibility that\nthis bug could be exploited to take complete control of the router,\nrather than simply crashing it.\n\nInsufficient bounds checking on the data buffer used for password\ninput allows the incoming password to exceed the buffer size,\noverwriting the contents of memory beyond the end of the\nbuffer. When the system tries to use the now-incorrect data in that\nmemory, unpredictable results occur. If the data are randomly\nchosen, this unpredictable behavior can be expected to result in\nthe detection of errors, such as accesses to illegal addresses,\nwhich result in system crashes. It might be possible to craft a\ndata string that, instead of creating detectable errors, caused\nparticular system behavior desired by the attacker.",

  "Impact": "Remote users who can telnet to a router can cause a denial of\nservice on the router. In our conversations with Cisco, they made it clear that this is a\nproblem for those folks who use the 700 series routers. However,\nthese are quite small and are used as end points within a network\nfor a small number of network connections. They are not used by\nthe big players like NSPs for example.",
