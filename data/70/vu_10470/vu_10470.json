  "Description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer v3.01 (and earlier?) has a\nserious bug which allows web page writers to use \".LNK\" and \".URL\"\nfiles to run programs on a remote computer. This bug is particularly\ndamaging because it uses NO ActiveX, and works even when Internet\nExplorer is set to its highest security level. It was tested on\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer Version 3.0 (4.70.1155) running Windows\n95. This demo assumes that Windows is installed in\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\". Windows 95 DOES NOT PROMPT BEFORE EXECUTING THESE FILES.\n\n.URL files are WORSE than .LNK files because .URLs work in both\nWindows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 (.LNK's only work in Windows 95). .URL\nfiles present a possibly greater danger because they can be easily\ncreated by server side scripts to meet the specific settings of a\nuser's system. We will provide .URL files for execution in the next\nday or so.",
