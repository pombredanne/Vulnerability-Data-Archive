  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could execute script in a different security domain than the one containing the attacker's document. By causing script to be run in the Local Machine Zone, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE. The attacker could also read or modify data in other web sites and in the Local Machine Zone (read cookies/content, modify/create content, etc.).",

  "Overview": "The Outlook Express MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents (MHTML) protocol handler does not adequately validate the source of alternate content. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access data and execute script in different security domains. By causing script to be run in the Local Machine Zone, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the program that invoked the handler, typically Internet Explorer (IE).",

  "Workarounds": "Note:  Disabling Active scripting or ActiveX controls is not an effective workaround Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in any zone does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Disabling these features in the Internet and Local Machine Zones (see MS KB Article 833633) may stop some attacks. <br> <a name=\"disableits\"> </a> Disable ITS and MHTML protocol handlers\nDisabling the ITS and MHTML protocol handlers may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Delete or rename the following registry keys: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\PROTOCOLS\\Handler\\{ms-its,ms-itss,its,mk,mhtml}\nModifying the Windows registry in this way may have unintended consequences. Disabling the ITS protocol handlers will reduce the functionality of the Windows help systems. Plan to undo these changes after patches have been tested and installed. Do not follow unsolicited links Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Read and send email in plain text format Outlook 2002 SP1 and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Maintain updated anti-virus software Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely solely on anti-virus software to defend against this vulnerability. US-CERT maintains a partial list of antivirus vendors. Use a different web browser There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME type determination, and ActiveX. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser. Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control, or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). It is possible for a different browser on a Windows system to invoke IE to handle MHTML protocol URLs."
