  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to use a vulnerable WebEOC site to execute arbitrary script. In addition, that attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive data from WebEOC site. This data may include any arbitrary information, such as authentication and medical information.",
  "Keywords": [
    "WebEOC",
    "Cross-site scripting",
    "xss"
  ],
  "Overview": "WebEOC contains multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that may allow a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary script using a vulnerable WebEOC site.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade \nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2. Validation checks have been added to all input fields that appeared to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
