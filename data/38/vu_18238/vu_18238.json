  "Description": "The Kerberos V4 server has been using the wrong random key generator\nwhich happens to be weak. Using a Sparcstation 5 (not a fast computer),\non average the session key for a ticket can be broken in a maximum 2-4\nminutes, and sometimes in much less time.",
  "ID": "VU#18238",
  "IDNumber": "18238",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Keys can be manufactured thereby circumventing the protection scheme\nthat Kerberos uses.",
  "Keywords": "kerberos",
  "Overview": "",
  "References": [
    "Version 5 is not vulnerable because it is using a DES-based random number",

    "The patches so far fixes only the server.  Subsequent patches will be needed",
    "to fix other programs which are using random_key instead of new_random_key."
