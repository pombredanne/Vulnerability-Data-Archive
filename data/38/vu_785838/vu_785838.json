  "Description": "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') TVT TD-2308SS-B DVR and possibly other models running firmware version 3.2.0.P-3520A-00 contain a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can use directory traversal to download critical files such as the config.dat file for the device which contains the credentials for the web interface. For example: http://[IP ADDRESS]/../../../mnt/mtd/config/config.dat This file can be parsed with the strings command to reveal the administrative user's plaintext credentials.",
  "ID": "VU#785838",
  "IDNumber": "785838",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can download the configuration file of the device and use the obtained administrator credentials to access the web interface. The attacker may then modify the settings of the device and have access to the connected cameras.",
