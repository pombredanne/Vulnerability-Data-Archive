  "Description": "CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element BeyondTrust PowerBroker for Windows version 5.1.0.132 and possibly earlier versions fail to register the full path of btpload32.dll and btpload64.dll in the AppInit_DLLs registry key. According to Microsoft: \"A system can contain multiple versions of the same dynamic-link library (DLL). Applications can control the location from which a DLL is loaded by specifying a full path or using another mechanism such as a manifest. If these methods are not used, the system searches for the DLL at load time as described in this topic.\" By failing to specify the full path of a DLL in AppInit_DLLs, an attacker could conduct a DLL search order hijacking attack and cause the application to load a malicious DLL named \"btpload32.dll\" or \"btpload64.dll\" from a location that is searched prior to the AppInit_DLLs registry key.",
