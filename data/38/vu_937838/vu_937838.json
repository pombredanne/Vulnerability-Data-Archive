  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Workaround Until and after the patch can be applied, consider restricting account access to only those users who are authorized to make configuration changes. It is also advisable to consider the use of firewalls/port blocking to restrict network authentication access to as few hosts as practical. Note that this will not completely mitigate this vulnerability, but will limit the vectors for attack."
