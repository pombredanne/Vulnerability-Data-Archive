  "Description": "S2 NetBox is a line of \"...open architecture, scalable, IP network-ready products for the physical security industry that integrate access control, alarm monitoring, video surveillance, and temperature monitoring.\" S2 Netbox systems are operated entirely via a web interface. The Netbox web server does not properly authenticate access to several directories, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access network node logs, employee photographs, and backup archives. Linear (formerly IEI) eMerge is based on S2 Netbox, and Sonitrol eAccess is based on Linear eMerge. eMerge and eAccess may also be affected by this vulnerability.",
  "ID": "VU#251133",
  "IDNumber": "251133",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can access node logs, backups, and employee photographs. An attacker may be able to crack passwords contained in a backup and gain administrative control over the system. Node logs and employee photographs could provide an attacker with reconnaissance information.",
  "Keywords": [
    "S2 Netbox",
    "Linear eMerge",
    "EDAC",
    "Sonitrol eAccess"
  ],
  "Overview": "S2 NetBox and related products do not adequately restrict access to node logs, backups, and employee photographs. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use information obtained from a vulnerable system to aid in further attacks.",
