  "Description": "Cisco firewalls protecting servers which offer service to the\ninternet-at-large are generally configured to provide a \"static\" NAT\nmapping to the servers. \"Conduits\" are specified, allowing inbound\ntraffic to specific services on specific ports.\n\nIf the firewall is configured to allow \"established\" TCP connections,\nand an outside machine initiates a connection to an inside machine on a\nTCP port for which a conduit is set up (i.e. an allowed connection),\nthat outside machine will subsequently, for a period of a few minutes,\nbe allowed to connect to ANY TCP port on the inside machine (i.e. ports\nnot specifically allowed in the firewall configuration). After several\nminutes of inactivity, the PIX will revert to the correct behaviour of\nnot allowing inbound connections for ports not specified by conduits.\nNote that the connection to the allowed port does not need to succeed -\nthere does not need to be a service running on the port on the inside\nmachine, it is enough that the connection is attempted to trigger the\nvulnerability.",

  "Impact": "If a PIX firewall is configured to allow \"established\" connections, an intruder who can establish a connection to any port on a machine behind the firewall can, for at least a few minutes, establish a connection to ANY port on that machine, thus defeating the purpose of the firewall in the first place. Further quoting from the Cisco Tech Note: The existence of any connection between an inside and an outside host is sufficient for the established command to permit connections from the outside host to the inside host. The direction in which the original connection was made is not checked. This is particularly concerning if an intruder can establish an ftp connection to an ftp server that supports the PORT command. This may enable an intruder to establish a connection to virtually any machine behind the firewall if any machine behind the firewall has a vulnerable ftp server, and runs a publicly available service. For more information, CERT Advisory 1997-27.",

  "Overview": "A somewhat common configuration of Cisco PIX firewalls may permit a window of opportunity in which an intruder can bypass the firewall. This problem was first publicly described in July, 1998.",
