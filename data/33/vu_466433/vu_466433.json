  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker who can intercept traffic that is destined to an affected web site may be able to take any action on the web site that the legitimate user can.",

  "Overview": "Web services that rely on cookies for authentication may be vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability. Some web sites transmit authentication material (often cookies) without encrypting the entire session, even when the authentication material is initially set over an encrypted HTTP session. This behavior could allow an attacker on the network path to obtain authentication material and impersonate a legitimate user. Sites that set authentication cookies over https during login and then later transmit the cookies over HTTP are particularly vulnerable, since users are more likely to think that the security of the login page applies to the entire session.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds for users\nAccessing the web site using encrypted HTTPS may mitigate this vulnerability. Note that the entire session, not just the initial username and password, will need to be encrypted . For this workaround to be completely effective, the secure attribute must be set on the cookie. Logging off from the web service may reduce the amount of time an attacker has to obtain credentials and exploit unprotected services. Users who can encrypt sensitive data locally by using PGP or GnuPG, password protected ZIP files, or other types of encryption before storing it on a web site may be able restrict what information an attacker can obtain by exploiting this vulnerability. Note that this workaround may not be feasible for all services offered by all vendors. The NoScript Firefox extension may mitigate these types of vulnerabilities by forcing specified websites to use HTTPs and by setting the secure attribute on cookies used by those sites. See the NoScript faq for more information. Evaluate the risks of accessing vulnerable sites before using the services while connected to untrusted networks. Workarounds for vendors\nProvide the ability for users to access the site using HTTPS, or at a minimum only transmit authentication credentials over HTTPS. For this workaround to be completely effective, the secure attribute must be set on the cookie. See section 4.2.2 of RFC 2109 for more details."
