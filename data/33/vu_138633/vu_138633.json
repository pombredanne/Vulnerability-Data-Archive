  "Workarounds": "Disable NetDDE If NetDDE is not required, disable the Network DDE and Network DDE DSDM services. Limit NetDDE share privileges If NetDDE is required, configure shares to have the least necessary privileges. From Digital Bond:  \"NetDDE allows a system to limit access to specific applications, documents, and even portions of the documents. Access and permissions can be set by user or group as well. The key is to avoid the wide open share like seen in the *|*.\"  Also, unless absolutely required, do not configure anonymous users to be members of the Everyone group (see KB 278259 for more information). Restrict NetDDE access Per Microsoft Security Bulletin  MS04-031 (which describes an unrelated NetDDE vulnerability in Windows), blocking the below ports at perimeter firewalls can prevent remote NetDDE connections (as well as NetBIOS and SMB connections). Ports 135/udp, 137/udp, 138/udp, 445/udp, 135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, and 593/tcp\nAll unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024\nAny other specifically configured RPC port"
