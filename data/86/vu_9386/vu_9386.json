  "Description": "FROM Microsoft Article ID: Q190288\n\nSechole.exe locates the memory address of a particular API function (OpenProcess) and modifies the instructions at that address in a running image of the exploit program on the local system. Sechole.exe requests debug rights that gives it elevated privileges. The request is successful because the access check for this right is expected to be done in the API that was successfully modified by the exploit program. Sechole.exe can now add the user who invoked Sechole.exe to the local Administrators group. ",
