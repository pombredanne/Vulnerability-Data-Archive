  "Description": "There is a serious problem with /usr/sbin/dop on Digital Unix 4.0\nand newer. /usr/sbin/dop does something like\nsystem(\"/usr/bin/x11/auth\") without setting the probler environment\nvariables so that ordinary users can get root access.\n\nShort time fix: chmod 000 /usr/sbin/dop\n\n/bin/nrdist on Digital Unix up to version 3.2g:\n\n/bin/nrdist is setuid root. I don't know if this version of rdist\nis buggy, howerver many versions of rdist are, and a usual advise\nis to remove the setuid bit from rdist if it is not\nused. /bin/nrdist has a different name so it is to easy to\noverlook.",
