  "VendorStatement": "The security of our systems and customer information is a top priority for Dell. Dell is aware of the recent security concerns that MITRE published, and is reviewing these claims against our products. Dell will take appropriate action to resolve any security related issues found on our products and provide updates to our customers. The vulnerability outlined by MITRE is not a Dell specific issue, but instead is a larger industry issue. An exploit of this vulnerability would have to be executed on a UEFI installed OS and executed under administrative privileges with driver-level access. Dell recommends that our customers use best security practices and lock down system admin modes as a standard part of their security process. BIOS Details Client Solutions (CS) commercial platforms do not use the UEFI code described in the MITRE vulnerability report during any BIOS or firmware update. The code exists in some client systems in a dormant state and may be discovered through binary analysis. Updated BIOS code has been developed to further quarantine this code during the boot process to mitigate any potential for indirect exploit. A list of BIOS update patches is included below for planning purposes and BIOS revisions are included (subject to change): Dell System\nBIOS Update\nRelease Planned\nLatitude 13 (3340)\nA03\nOct-14\nLatitude 6430U\nA09\nOct-14\nLatitude E5440/E5540\nA09\nNov-14\nLatitude E5530/E5430\nA15\nOct-14\nLatitude E6230/E6330/E6430S\nA14\nOct-14\nLatitude E6530\nA16\nOct-14\nLatitude E6430\nA16\nOct-14\nLatitude E6440\nA09\nNov-14\nLatitude E6540\nA12\nNov-14\nLatitude E7240/E7440\nA12\nNov-14\nOptiPlex 3010\nA13\nNov-14\nOptiPlex 3011 AIO\nA06\nOct-14\nOptiPlex 3020\nA05\nOct-14\nOptiPlex 7010/9010\nA19\nOct-14\nOptiPlex 7020/9020\nA08\nOct-14\nOptiPlex 9010 AIO\nA16\nOct-14\nOptiPlex 9020 AIO\nA09\nOct-14\nPrecision Mobile Workstation M4700\nA13\nOct-14\nPrecision Mobile Workstation M6700\nA14\nOct-14\nPrecision Workstation R7610\nA08\nNov-14\nPrecision Workstation T1650\nA18\nNov-14\nPrecision Workstation T1700\nA11\nOct-14\nPrecision Workstation T3610/T5610/T7610\nA09\nNov-14\nPrecision Workstation M6800/M4800\nA11\nNov-14\nPowerEdge Server T20\nA06\nNov-14\nVenue 11 Pro (5130-32Bit)\nA09\nOct-14\nVenue 11 Pro (5130-64Bit)\nA02\nOct-14\nVenue 11 Pro (7130/7139)\nA13\nOct-14\nVenue 8 Pro (5830)\nA09\nOct-14"
