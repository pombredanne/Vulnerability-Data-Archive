  "Description": "CWE-400:Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\nMcAfee Managed Agent versions 4.5 and 4.6 contain a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. McAfee Managed Agent runs a service on Windows workstations called \"McAfee Framework Service\" (FrameworkService.exe) which runs an HTTP server on the default TCP port 8081. By sending a crafted request an attacker can remotely crash the Windows service. This can cause the McAfee software to temporarily stop updating or provide log data until the service is manually restarted.",
