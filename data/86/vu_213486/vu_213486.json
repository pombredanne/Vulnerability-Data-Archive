  "Description": "According to LifeSize's website \"LifeSize Room combines an immersive, high definition video experience with a rich set of features to deliver a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use video communication solution.\" The LifeSize Room appliance contains an embedded web interface that allows administrative access to the appliance. This web interface fails to sanitize input from unauthenticated clients leading to an authentication bypass and possibly arbitrary code injection. Using a proxy tool to intercept traffic between the attacker and the LifeSize Room appliance web interface, an unauthenticated attacker makes a request to the gateway.php web page that references the LSRoom_Remoting.authenticate function. The attacker can modify the Action Message Format (AMF) data in the response from the server, changing the value from \"false\" to \"true\" allowing the attacker to bypass the appliance web interface authentication. An additional vulnerability exists when an unauthenticated attacker makes a request to the gateway.php web page that references the LSRoom_Remoting.doCommand function. Using a proxy tool to intercept traffic between the attacker and the LifeSize Room appliance system web interface, the attacker can modify the AMF data in the original parameter \"pref -l /var/system/upgrade/status\" in the vulnerable LSRoom_Remoting.doCommand function to be an arbitrary command that will run with the permission of the webserver. According to the vulnerability reporter LifeSize Room LS_RM1_3.5.3 (11) and 4.7.18 is vulnerable, and possibly other versions.",
