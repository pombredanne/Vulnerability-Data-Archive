  "Description": "From a posting by Brooke Paul <brooke@bpaul.com> to ssh-bugs@cs.hut.fi\n\nIt appears that if you run SSH as a user on a high port, proper logging\nis not maintained.  If sshd is being run by my uid on port 4000,\nonly my uid may use it (since sshd is not suid 0).  The session does\nnot appear in lastlog, and returns errant data for 'w' as well.  I\nwouldn't normally panic too much about this, except that the user gets\nboth an encrypted tunnel to pass nearly anything and a non-logged session.\n\n  I have verified this behavior under Solaris 2.5.1, RedHat 5.1, and\nRedHat 5.0, running SSH 1.2.26 & 1.2.17.",
