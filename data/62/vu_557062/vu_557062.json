  "Workarounds": "Upgrade your version of CUPS This issue is resolved in CUPS 1.1.22rc1. Starting with this version, the connection string for the printer is sanitized so that it does not contain sensitive information. Restrict access to the CUPS log file By default, the CUPS log file is world-readable. Access to the CUPS log file can be restricted by setting the LogFilePerm option in cupsd.conf to \"0600\" Do not use authenticated printing to Windows via Samba Because of the possibility of disclosing sensitive information when using a printer shared via SMB, it is suggested to use other protocols such as LPD. Windows can function as an LPD server when Print Services for UNIX is installed."
