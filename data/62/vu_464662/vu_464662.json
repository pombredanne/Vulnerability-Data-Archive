  "Impact": "This flaw makes it possible to identify the system that has sent a given piece of electronic mail with the Mail application. An intruder may use this information, which is usually transmitted in cleartext and received on a remote system, to deduce a valid MAC address to use on a foreign network in order to gain access. This value may also be used to deduce the sender of anonymized or privatized mail.",
