  "Description": "Some Network Interface Cards (NICs) allow software-control of the MAC Address. For example, the 3COM 3C905 Etherlink XL allows you to set a MAC address by changing values in a configuration file (in the case of Windows, by changing a value in the registtry.) \n\nAn intruder could repeatedly change MAC addresses and request a new IP address assignment from either a bootp server or a DHCP server. Eventually, the attacker could consume all the available addresses. ",
