  "Workarounds": "The following procedure has to be followed for each certifier [or identifier] used on each Notes desktop. This procedure must be repeated per user.id file per desktop. Start Notes and for each .id file available, do the following Select File -> Tools -> Switch ID \nSelect an .id file \nClick the Open button, a dialog will prompt for the passphrase for this identifier \nSelect File -> Tools -> User Preferences \nClick the \"Security Options\" button, and the  \"Workstation Security: ECL\" dialog appears \nChoose -Default- \nUncheck all of the checkboxes to the right \nChoose -No Signature- \nUncheck all of the checkboxes to the right \nClick the \"Add\" button, and the \"Add User\" dialog appears \nClick the little blue man button, and the \"Names\" dialog appears \nSelect the appropriate address book  \nSelect any developers who write code used on your systems, and click the Add button \nClick Ok button to dismiss \"Names\" dialog \nFor each authorized developer that you added, set the ECL appropriately. Click the Ok button to dismiss the \"Workstation Security: ECL\" dialog Note that even if you do not use Notes for electronic mail, the same situation applies to any database that can receive mail. It may be possible to automate this procedure via LotusScript."
