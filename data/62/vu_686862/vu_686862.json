  "ID": "VU#686862",
  "IDNumber": "686862",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An authenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system using krb5_aname_to_localname() mapping. The vulnerable library is loaded by services that use Kerberos authentication (e.g., telnetd, klogind), and in most cases these services run with root privileges.",
  "Keywords": [
    "MIT Kerberos",
    "buffer overflow",
    "krb5_aname_to_localname()"
  ],
  "Overview": "MIT Kerberos 5 contains several heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in code that translates Kerberos principal names to local UNIX account names. An authenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with root privileges.",
