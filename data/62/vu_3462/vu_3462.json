  "Description": "From the FreeBSD advisory FreeBSD-SA-98:02:\n\nThe 4.4BSD VM system allows files to be \"memory mapped\", which\ncauses the specified contents of a file to be made available to a\nprocess via its address space. Manipulations of that file can then\nbe performed simply by manipulating memory, rather than using\nfilesystem I/O calls.  This technique is used to simplify code,\nspeed up access to files, and provide interprocess communication.",
