  "Impact": "An attacker can create files with arbitrary names. The contents of the file can be influenced by the intruder, but it is unclear if the influence can be leveraged in any useful way.",

  "Resolution": "The latest versions of Windows address this problem by limiting the number of times the control can be called before issuing a \"denial-of-service\" error message. (See Q242366) . This prevents attackers from using the control simply to create large numbers of files. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a general purpose fix to the problem.",
