  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Blocking access to ports 139/tcp and 445/tcp on  vulnerable systems will mitigate this vulnerability. Administrators can configure mobile systems that use the Windows Firewall to open these ports only when the user is authenticated to a domain controller by using the firewall's \"profile\" feature. Disable SMBv2 Disabling SMBv2 will mitigate this issue. The below steps to disable SMBv2 are provided in Microsoft Security Advisory 975497. Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK. Locate and then click the following registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\nClick LanmanServer. Click Parameters. Right-click to add a new DWORD (32 bit) Value. Enter smb2 in the Name data field, and change the Value data field to 0. Exit. From a command prompt and with administrator privileges, type net stop server and then net start server."
