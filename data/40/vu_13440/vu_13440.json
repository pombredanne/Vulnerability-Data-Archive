  "Description": "All versions of bind before release 8.1.1 were succeptible to an\nattack where a DNS query is made and more information than that\nsufficient to answer the original question is returned.  For\nexample, when quering for the address of foo.baddomain.org (note:\nthis name for example purposes only), its name server could return\nthat information as well as the NS record for some other domain,\nsay microsoft.com.  All versions of bind before 8.1.1 will happily\ncache that information and use it when called upon.\n\nIf that new NS record for microsoft.com points baddomain.org, it\ncan then change the responses for the microsoft.com domain to\nperpetrate whatever problem they wish.  That is, then the mapping\nbetween host names and IP addresses is changed, the information\nsent by a host who is using this changed information may be then\ninspected, captured, or corrupted.",
