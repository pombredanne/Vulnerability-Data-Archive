  "Resolution": "The following information is based on Linux kernel code from The Linux Kernel Archives. Individual distributions may have different default configurations. For Linux kernels 2.2.0-pre5 to 2.2.14, comment out or remove the following line in ip_masq.c and recompile the kernel: #define CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_DEFAULT 1\nFor Linux kernels 2.2.15 and above, DLOOSE behavior is disabled by default. To confirm that DLOOSE behavior is disabled, check the existence and contents of the following file: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_masq_udp_dloose\nIf this file exists and contains a '1' or a '2', then the system is configured for DLOOSE behavior. If this file does not exist or contains anything other than the values '1' or '2', then the system is configured not to use DLOOSE behavior.",
