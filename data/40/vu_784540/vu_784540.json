  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service in a vulnerable system. In most cases, the attacker would need to act as a valid BGP peer. BGP session instability can result in \"flapping\" and other routing problems that may adversely affect Internet traffic.",
  "Keywords": [
    "malformed BGP open message",
    "DoS",
    "denial of service",

  "Overview": "Multiple implementations of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) contain vulnerabilities related to the processing of UPDATE and OPEN messages. The impacts of these vulnerabilities appear to be limited to denial of service.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict BGP access Using access control lists (ACLs) and BGP configuration settings, restrict access to valid networks and BGP peers. Authenticate BGP messages TCP MD5 (RFC 2385), IPsec, and S-BGP provide cryptographic authentication of network connections and/or BGP messages. Various performance and key distribution issues are associated with these authentication methods. Use out-of-band management channels When possible, use an out-of-band channel, such as a separate network, to transmit BGP other management traffic."
