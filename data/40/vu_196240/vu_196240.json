  "Workarounds": "Disable the preprocessor Disable the DCE/RPC preprocessor (dcerpc) by removing the DCE/RPC preprocessor directives from the configuration file (often /etc/snort.conf or user.conf). Note that disabling this preprocessor may allow fragmented attacks to evade the Snort sensor. See Sourcefire Advisory 2007-02-19 for more details."
