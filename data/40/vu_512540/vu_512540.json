  "Workarounds": "Disable IPv6 Disabling IPv6 on internal hosts will mitigate this vulnerability. For information regarding changing IPv6 settings in specific operating systems, see the systems affected portion of this document. Enable the AirPort Extreme firewall Enabling the AirPort Extreme's built in firewall may mitigate this vulnerability. To enable the firewall using the AirPort configuration utility, go to the advanced tab, then the IPv6 tab, and check Block incoming IPv6 connections checkbox."
