  "Impact": "An attacker with local access to the system on which the Oracle system is installed may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the oracle user and the dba group. This allows the attacker to take any action that the database administrator is authorized to take. Attackers may be able to gain additional system privileges, depending on how the system is configured.",
