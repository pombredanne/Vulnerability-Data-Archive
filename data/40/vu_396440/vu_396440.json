  "Description": "CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2016-6890 The Subject Alt Name field of X.509 certificates is not properly parsed. A specially crafted certificate may result in a heap-based buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - CVE-2016-6891 The ASN.1 Bit Field is not properly parsed. A specially crafted certificate may lead to a denial of service condition due to an out of bounds read in memory. CWE-590: Free of Memory not on the Heap - CVE-2016-6892 The x509FreeExtensions() function does not properly parse X.509 certificates. A specially crafted certificate may cause a free operation on unallocated memory, resulting in a denial of service condition. The CVSS score below describes CVE-2016-6890. For more information about these vulnerabilities, contact the vendor at support@matrixssl.com or refer to the vendor release notes and the researcher's blog.",
