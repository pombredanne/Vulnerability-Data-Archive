  "VendorStatement": "\"DragonFly is 64-bit only now so the current release is not \naffected.\u00a0 However, older versions of DragonFly (prior to us going 64-bit only) \nare vulnerable.\u00a0 Despite the vulnerability I'm not sure I would classify this \nas a serious problem because it is highly unlikely that programs using the \nlibrary would allow a 700MB+ pattern string in the first place.\u00a0 Patterns of \nthat size certainly can't be passed on the command line due to OS exec argument \nbuffer limitations. That said, we will commit a length check to avoid any possible overflow.\""
