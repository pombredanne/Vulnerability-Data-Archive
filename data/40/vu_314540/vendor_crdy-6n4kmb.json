  "VendorStatement": "Subject:       XSS Vulnerability in Pubcookie App Server Modules\nAuthor:        Nathan Dors, Pubcookie Project\nStatus:        Confirmed, Patches Released\nThreat Class:  Cross-Site Scripting\nIssue date:    March 6, 2006\nSeverity:      High Summary: New releases of Pubcookie are available to address Cross-Site Scripting\n(XSS) vulnerabilities found in the Pubcookie application server modules\nfor Apache and Microsoft IIS. System administrators running a Pubcookie application server are\nstrongly advised to read this security advisory and carry out the\nsuggested actions below. Note: The URL for this security advisory is: http://pubcookie.org/news/20060306-apps-secadv.html Background: XSS vulnerabilities typically involve three principals: a vulnerable Web\nsite, an attacker, and an end-user. The attacker exploits the\nvulnerability in the Web site such that script written by the attacker\nis run by the user within the security context of the Web site. XSS vulnerabilities can be classified as persistent or non-persistent,\ndepending on whether or not the script or HTML injected by the attacker\npersists on the vulnerable Web site. A persistent XSS vulerability allows the attacker to leave script or\nHTML on the vulnerable Web site where it has the potential of being run\nby multiple users without further involvement by the attacker. Blogs and\nmessage boards are example places where persistent XSS vulnerabilities\nare often exploited. A non-persistent XSS vulnerability, on the other hand, doesn't allow the\nattacker to stage script or HTML on the vulnerable Web site. Instead, he\nor she must stage it elsewhere and then orchestrate some other means of\ninitiating the attack, very often requiring the user's unintentional\ncooperation. Email, chat messages, and web pages are example places\nwhere script might be staged to help exploit a non-persistent XSS\nvulnerability. The user might trigger the attack simply by opening a\ntainted message or Web page, or by clicking inadvertently on a tainted\nlink. Pubcookie Application Server Details: Non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities were found in the Pubcookie Apache\nmodule (mod_pubcookie) and ISAPI filter. These components mishandle\nuntrusted data when printing responses to the browser. This makes them\nvulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script or HTML. If\nan attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged\ncontent, the attacker can use it to redirect the user to a vulnerable\nPubcookie application server and attempt to exploit the XSS\nvulnerabilities. Threat Classification: These vulnerabilities are classified as *high* due to the nature and\npurpose of Pubcookie application servers for user authentication and Web\nSingle Sign-on (SSO). An attacker who injects malicious script through\nthe vulnerabilities might steal private Pubcookie data including a\nuser's authentication assertion (\"granting\") cookies and application\nsession cookies. Affected Versions: Apache module (mod_pubcookie): This advisory applies to the following\nversions of the Pubcookie Apache module (including beta and final\nreleases): 1.x, 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.1a and 3.3.0. ISAPI filter: This advisory applies to the following versions of the\nPubcookie ISAPI filter (including beta and final releases): 3.1.0,\n3.1.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.1a and 3.3.0. Patch Releases: The following patch releases address all known XSS vulnerabilities: * 3.3.0a (current production release; Unix and Windows)\n* 3.2.1b (Unix-only patch release) These releases are available now from the project's dowloads page: http://pubcookie.org/downloads.html Suggested Action: Application servers running an affected version should upgrade to one of\nthe patch releases. Version 3.3.0a is the current production release. Note: For detailed version compatibility notes and upgrade information,\nconsult the relevant Pubcookie application server documentation. Project Response: * 18 Dec 2005: Vulnerabilities discovered. * 18 Dec 2005: Initial contact with technical details of vulnerability. * 18 Dec 2005: Initial response confirming exploit and severity. * 05 Jan 2006: Initial patches available for hardness testing. * 06 Feb 2006: Solutions available for all known vulnerabilities. * xx Mar 2006: Coordinated public release of security advisory.
