  "Overview": "Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) will execute an HTML Application (HTA) referenced by the DATA attribute of an OBJECT element if the Content-Type header returned by the web server is set to \"application/hta\". An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE. Note: (2003-10-04) The patch provided by MS03-040 addresses two attack vectors that were not resolved by MS03-032.",

  "Resolution": "Apply patch\nApply the patch (828750) referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a more recent cumulative patch. CAN-2003-0838 and CAN-2003-0809 correspond to the attack vectors that use script (2) and XML Data Binding (3), respectively. The patch (822925) referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-032 (released on 2003-08-20) stops HTAs from executing in one case in which static HTML is used to create an OBJECT element referencing the HTA(1). The patch does not prevent HTAs from executing in at least two other cases in which the requisite HTML is generated by script (2) or by XML Data Binding (3).",

  "Workarounds": "Disable ActiveX controls and plug-ins It appears that disabling the \"Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins\" setting will prevent OBJECT elements from being instantiated, thus preventing exploitation of this vulnerability. Disable \"Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins\" in the Internet Zone and any zone used to read HTML email. In our tests, this setting prevented OBJECT elements from being instantiated and therefore stopped sample exploits from running. It has been reported that disabling ActiveX controls and plug-ins is not completely effective. Apply the Outlook Email Security Update Another way to effectively disable ActiveX controls and plug-ins in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where ActiveX controls and plug-ins and Active scripting are disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Unmap HTA MIME type Deleting or renaming the following registry key prevents HTAs from executing in the three cases listed above: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\MIME\\Database\\Content Type\\application/hta\nNote that there may be other attack vectors that do not rely on this MIME setting. Block Content-Type headers Use an application layer firewall, HTTP proxy, or similar technology to block or modify HTTP Content-Type headers with the value \"application/hta\". This technique may not work for encrypted HTTP connections and it may break applications that require the \"application/hta\" Content-Type header. Block mshta.exe Use a host-based firewall to deny network access to the HTA host:  %SystemRoot%\\system32\\mshta.exe. Examining network traces of known attack vectors, it seems that the exploit HTML/HTA code is accessed three times, twice by IE and once by mshta.exe. The HTA is instantiated at some point before the third access attempt. Blocking mshta.exe prevents the third access attempt, which appears prevent the exploit code from being loaded into the HTA. There may be other attack vectors that circumvent this workaround. For example, a vulnerability that allowed data in the browser cache to be loaded into the HTA could remove the need for mshta.exe to access the network. This technique may break applications that require HTAs to access the network. Also, specific host-based firewalls may or may not properly block mshta.exe from accessing the network. Maintain updated antivirus software Antivirus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on antivirus software to defend against this vulnerability. The CERT/CC maintains a partial list of antivirus vendors."
