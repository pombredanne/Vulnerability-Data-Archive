  "ID": "VU#190540",
  "IDNumber": "190540",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers that are able to send malformed UDP echo packets to the vulnerable service can capture the replies and obtain portions of data stored in the devices's memory.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Cisco",
    "IOS device",
    "information disclosure",
    "malformed UDP echo packet"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Cisco IOS echo service fails to properly handle malformed UDP echo packets when the udp-small-servers command is enabled. A remote attacker could obtain portions of data stored in the devices's memory.",

  "Resolution": "Cisco has released an advisory that provides instructions for obtaining fixed software. Because there are many possible combinations of hardware and software configurations, the CERT/CC recommends that all users of IOS and software consult the following Cisco Security Advisory: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sn-20030731-ios-udp-echo.shtml",

  "Workarounds": "Disable udp-small-services According to Cisco: The workaround is to disable udp-small-services. The syntax for this command on routers and switches running Cisco IOS software is as follows: no service udp-small-servers The udp-small-servers command is disabled by default since Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2(1). It is always recommended to disable unnecessary services on routers and switches. Refer to Improving Security on Cisco Routers for more information on improving router security."
