  "Description": "Automated Solutions Modbus/TCP Master OPC Server contains a heap corruption vulnerability. The server is vulnerable to an attacker writing an arbitrary number of double words or DWORDs onto the heap. For additional information see ICSA-10-322-02A. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.",
  "ID": "VU#768840",
  "IDNumber": "768840",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation would likely not allow arbitrary code execution; however, an exploit could possibly corrupt the OPC server memory and cause a denial of service.",
