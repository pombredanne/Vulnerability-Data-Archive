  "Impact": "Access the server is required prior to exploitation of this vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to an authenticated user executing arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the server process. If the server is setup to permit anonymous access, then authentication is not a requirement for exploitation.",
