  "Description": "According to Sielco Sistemi's website: \"Winlog is a software package for SCADA/HMI applications with web support, OPC client and a wide library of communication drivers and protocols for most PLCs (Siemens, Omron, Allen Bradley, Modbus, etc.)\" Sielco Sistemi Winlog has the capability to accept remote connections by enabling the \"Run TCP/IP server\" option. The server listens on port 46823/tcp. A specially crafted packet from a remote attacker can cause a stack overflow possibly allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. For additional information see ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-11-017-02. Public exploit code is available for this vulnerability.",
