  "Impact": "A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information from the memory of the web server, including userids, passwords, cookies or authentication data belonging to other users of the web server. With this data the attacker may be able to falsely authenticate themselves to the web server as other users. In some cases, the attacker may be able to prevent the normal operation of the web server using this vulnerability.",

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow exists in the iPlanet Web Servers (Enterprise and FastTrack Editions) that may allow remote attackers to gain read access to sensitive information contained in the memory of the web server process. The information disclosed may include userids, passwords, cookies or authentication data belonging to other users of the web server. With this data the attacker may be able to falsely authenticate themselves to the web server as other users. In some cases, the attacker may be able to prevent the normal operation of the web server using this vulnerability.",

  "Workarounds": "Filter HTTP Requests with Large Headers Sites that are able to deploy a monitoring system between the Internet and their web server may be able to detect and block packets with large amounts of header data. Possible mechanisms include an NSAPI filter, an active intrusion detection system, or a reverse-proxy web server. The @Stake advisory contains more detailed suggestions for detecting and monitoring malicious HTTP requests of this type."
