  "Description": "/usr/sbin/scanners, GUI tool for scanners setup, root-suid, contains an ugly\nand easily exploitable bug that allows any local user to gain root\npriviledges.  It's part of Impressario package.  I'm not sure about the\nscope of the problem.  The one that comes with Irix 5.3 is vulnerable, the\none in 6.2 seems to be fixed. However, it seems like SGI is aware of this\nkind of vulnerability, so there may be a patch available. Quick check\n\nstrings /usr/sbin/scanners | grep SGIHELPROOT\n\nif string is found, your system is probably vulnerable.\n\nABOUT IMPRESSARIO --\n\nImpressario software provides a visual printing and scanning\nenvironment. Impressario allows the user to control resolution, paper\nsize, double-sided printing, text orientation, etc. Impressario gives\nyou full printer status in a network-queryable format, so you can find\nout locally or from a remote system when the printer is out of toner,\nout of paper, has a jam, isn't turned on, etc.\n\nImpressario contains drivers for many popular printers and\nscanners. (Printer manufactures may also provide drivers that work\nunder the Impressario environment.)\n\nImpressario allows you to directly print many types of files. See\nthe question \"What types of image files can Impressario print?\" for\ndetails.\n\nImpressario contains a PostScript interpreter, and can often\ndrive the same printer faster than the printers' built-in interpreter\n(at equal or lower cost then adding a PostScript interpreter to the\nprinter).\n\nImpressario also supports scanners. The graphical scan tool\nallows you to view data from a scanner, file, local or remote\nworkstation display and send the data to a printer, file, or\nworkstation display. The Scanner installation tool provides a simple\ninterface for installing and configuring scanners on your workstation.\n\nFor more info see\nImpressario http://www-europe.sgi.com/Technology/Impressario/faq.html#Q1",
