  "Impact": "Arbitrary may code be executed on a victim system running vulnerable OpenSSH sshd implementations. Versions of OpenSSH sshd 3.0 and 3.1 may only be attacked by users with valid AFS/Kerberos 4 credentials and authorized to access the targeted system. Systems with OpenSSH sshd version earlier than 2.9.9 may be attacked remotely if the network port sshd is listening on, typically 22/tcp, is open.",

  "Overview": "A  defect in the OpenSSH implementation of a secure shell daemon (SecSSH sshd) allows arbitrary users to overflow a buffer. This may lead to arbitrary code being executed on the victim system. Versions of OpenSSH sshd 2.9.9, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, and 3.1 may only be attacked by users with authorization to connect to the victim system. Systems running OpenSSH sshd prior to version 2.9.9 may be attacked by an intruder able to connect to a network port sshd is listening on, typically 22/tcp, with or without authorization. Systems using OpenSSH 3.3 are not vulnerable to attack via this defect.",
