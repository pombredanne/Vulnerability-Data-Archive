  "Description": "Objectivity/DB comes with several administration tools for database maintenance. By design, these tools do not require authentication. An attacker can emulate the functionality of the administration tools with a custom script as well.",
  "ID": "VU#782567",
  "IDNumber": "782567",
  "IPProtocol": [
    "tcp,",
    "tcp"
  ],
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can run commands on the database server. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the data can be compromised by the attacker.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Objectivity DB",
    "authentication"
  ],
  "Overview": "The administration tools (i.e. ookillls, oostopams, etc) for Objectivity/DB do not require authentication for local or remote operation.",
  "References": "http://devnet.objectivity.com/files/docs/objy_docs/latest/administration.pdf",
  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
  "Revision": 11,

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict remote access to only trusted sources or blocked entirely and administration only done locally. TCP ports 6779 and 6780 should be filtered."
