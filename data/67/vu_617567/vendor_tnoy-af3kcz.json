  "Revision": 6,
  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "TrackR",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",

  "VendorReferences": "None",
  "VendorStatement": "We work in a fast-moving and exciting market, so we are constantly trying to \nimprove our product and satisfy our customers. Like other IOT companies large and small, we also have to keep pace with the \never-evolving threats which are redefining IT security. So we want to thank the \nteam at Rapid7 for helping us pinpoint our efforts in this area. Regarding the claim that retrieve TrackR doesn\u2019t require authentication, we \nknew about this issue and fixed it several months ago. After that time, the \ndeprecated call remained online, but was no longer in use by any apps. We are \ngrateful that Rapid7 brought this possible point of confusion to our attention; as of yesterday, that call has been completely removed but no consumers have \nhad access since we became aware of this issue in the spring. Regarding the claim that passwords are stored in plain text on iOS datastore, \nas soon as we became aware of this yesterday, we took action with an iOS update \nalready submitted. Regarding the claim that sending TrackR data calls aren\u2019t secure, as soon as we \nbecame aware of this yesterday, our engineering team designed a fix that will \nbe applied by the end of next week (week of October 31st). Regarding the claim that TrackR broadcasts a unique identifier, this is by \ndesign. This enables the TrackR app to be more power efficient for conducting \nCrowd GPS updates. This is a function common in all tracking devices with Crowd \nGPS capabilities. There is no user data stored in the device and enabling \nconnection only allows for nearby users to ring the device. When the device is \nnearby the user, the device doesn\u2019t advertise."
