  "Description": "Many versions of troff/nroff, including the GNU variants, have commands that allow\nprograms to be executed.  Standard troff/nroff supports the .sy (system) command\nthat, yes, appears to use the system command.  There is also a .pi command\nwhich is used to pipe to a command.\n\nThis gets interesting when a troff type is added to a mailcap meaning that email\nsent with that troff type can cause commands to be executed when you read the mail.\nAs suggested by the reporter, this is reminiscent of the ghostscript hole described\nin CA-95:10.\n\nIn addition, on some systems, and Linux appears to be one, man is setuid so that\nit can write into the catman directory.  This means that one can only run commands\nas that user.  Now, if that user is root, you can become root on your own system by\nrunning man on one of your own man pages, and since you can specify the man path,\nwell, this is not good.\n\nIn addition, in GNU groff, there are the following additional commands:\n\n.open\tOpen filename for writing and associate the stream\nnamed stream with it.\n\n.opena\tLike open, but if filename exists, append to it instead\nof truncating it.\n\n.pso\tThis is behaves like the so request except that input\ncomes from the standard output of command.\n\nGroff does take a -S option, which from the man page means:\n\n-S      Safer mode.  Pass the -S option to gpic  and  use\nthe -msafer macros with gtroff.\n\nThe -msafer macros are the following:\n\n.rm open opena pso sy pi\n.de unsafe\n.tm \\\\n(.F:\\\\n(.c: unsafe to execute request `\\\\$1'\n..\n.als open unsafe\n.als opena unsafe\n.als pso unsafe\n.als sy unsafe\n.als pi unsafe",
