  "Impact": "An intruder may be able to use this vulnerability to send mail (Spam), post News, get or send files from or to an FTP server, or send data to an HTTP server. It may even be possible to exploit a vulnerability in one of these services through this problem, though we are not certain of that at this time. For example, an intruder may be able to exploit this problem as a means of attacking a vulnerable web server that would ordinarily be protected by a firewall. Additionally, it may be possible for an intruder to cause denial-of-service conditions within the network by sending unexpected data to network services. This unexpected data may crash or hang the services receiving the data.",

  "Overview": "An intruder can send certain kinds of data to services that he is not ordinarily able to reach. By crafting the data such that it is redirected through any program the victim uses to render the malicious HTML, the intruder is able send that data to any services that the victim can send data to. The malicious HTML can be embedded in documents such as an email message, web page, rich-text log or newsgroup posting.",
