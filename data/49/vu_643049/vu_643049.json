  "IDNumber": "643049",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to take any action that an authorized user can including restarting the cable modem, or forcing it to reload its configuration file. While a cable modem is rebooting systems that rely on the affected modem will have limited ability to access the Internet.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Restricting access to the Surfboard's web interface by using proxy filtering rules, router access control lists or firewall rules will mitigate this vulnerability. To effectively block access, the rules must prevent users on the LAN side of the cable modem from connecting to the web interface's IP address (usually 192.168.100.1)."
