  "Workarounds": "Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7 Microsoft has published more information on DEP as a mitigation for this vulnerability. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but DEP can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts \"Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology\" part 1 and part 2. Use of DEP should be considered in conjunction with other mitigations described in this document. Set the Internet zone security setting to \"High\" Setting the Internet zone security setting to \"High\" will result in the user being prompted before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting, which may reduce the risk of certain attack vectors. Disable Active Scripting Disabling Active Scripting will prevent Active Scripting from running, which may reduce the risk of certain attack vectors."
