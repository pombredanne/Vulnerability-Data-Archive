  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting As noted in Microsoft Security Advisory (977981), consider disabling Active Scripting. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in Microsoft Security Advisory (977981) and \"Securing Your Web Browser.\" Enable DEP As noted in Microsoft Security Advisory (977981), consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP). Disabling scripting and enabling DEP do not resolve the vulnerability, but they greatly lower the chances of an attacker being able to execute arbitrary code. Use Internet Explorer 8 According to Microsoft Security Advisory (977981), Internet Explorer 8 is not affected."
