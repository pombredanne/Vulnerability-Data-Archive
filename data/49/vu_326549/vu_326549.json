  "Description": "Microsoft Windows contains a script injection vulnerability caused by the way MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document. According to Microsoft TechNet Security Research & Defense blog: \"It is possible under certain conditions for this vulnerability to allow an attacker to inject a client-side script in the response of a Web request run in the context of the victim's Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site on behalf of the targeted user.\"",
  "ID": "VU#326549",
  "IDNumber": "326549",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to obtain access to web content in another domain. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see CERT Advisory CA-2000-02.",
