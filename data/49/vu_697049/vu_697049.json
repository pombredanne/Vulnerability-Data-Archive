  "ID": "VU#697049",
  "IDNumber": "697049",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CSAdmin process or cause a denial of service. CSAdmin typically runs with Local System privileges, therefore an attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. The compromise of a Secure ACS system could lead to the disclosure of other user credentials.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access to Secure ACS Systems Restrict access to Secure ACS systems to trusted hosts and networks. Use firewall/router ACLs to limit access to Secure ACS to trusted hosts and networks. Secure ACS provides the ability to restrict access based on IP addresses (see page 10-12 of the User Guide for Cisco Secure ACS for Windows Server). Bind the CSAdmin HTML server to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) and connect to the Secure ACS host with another secure remote access protocol (Terminal Services/RDP, IPsec, L2TP, SSH). Note also that SSL can be used to encrypt the HTTP connection to CSAdmin (see page 10-13 of the User Guide for Cisco Secure ACS for Windows Server)."
