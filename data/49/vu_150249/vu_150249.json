  "ID": "VU#150249",
  "IDNumber": "150249",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to predict pseudo-randomly generated data from OpenSSL. This can weaken the protection provided by OpenSSL's cryptography.",
  "Keywords": [
    "OpenSSL",
    "FIPS",
    "Object Module",
    "authentication bypass",
    "PRNG",

  "Resolution": "Wait for an approved patched distribution\nThis vulnerability is described in OpenSSL Security Advisory [29-Nov-2007]. This advisory describes the patches that demonstrate two different fixes for the vulnerability. However, FIPS 140-2 validation must be performed before the fixes can be incorporated into a validated module.",
