  "Description": "Quoted from the reporter:\n\n{...} It is fairly easy to unencrypt a MS password if the challenge\nhas set to zero via dictionary attacks.  Sequential search brute\nforce attacks work as well if you can guess what types of\ncharacters are most common in the password.  Yes, it is time\nconsuming, but if your account gets hacked, is it really worth it?\n\n#4\tuses modified SMB to capture username & hashed passwords,\nbut smb challenge has been set to all zeros to make a one\nto one correspondance between username & password.\n\n#5\tuses modified HTTP to capture username & hashed passwords,\nbut NTLM challenge has been set to all zeros to make a one\nto one correspondance between username & password.  Web\npage will cross reference hash in a precomputed lookup\ntable to return original password. (there is no SALT like\nunix)\n\n#6\tConnects to WINS server on local net and primes IP-Name\npair to exploit via SMB.  Win95 will speak plain text\npasswords to rogue SMB server. (and get logged)",
