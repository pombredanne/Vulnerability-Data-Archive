  "Description": "Nuance provides two similar PDF viewing products called PDF Reader and PDF Viewer Plus. Both of these products contain multiple exploitable memory-corruption vulnerabilities. We have found that both Nuance PDF Reader 7.0 and PDF Viewer Plus 7.1 are affected.",
  "ID": "VU#248449",
  "IDNumber": "248449",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted PDF document, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
  "Keywords": "FOE",
  "Overview": "Nuance PDF viewing products contain multiple memory-corruption vulnerabilities, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",

  "Workarounds": "Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0 on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will. Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts \"Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology\" part 1 and part 2. DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document. Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR for more details."
