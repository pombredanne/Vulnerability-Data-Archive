  "Workarounds": "Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-028 suggests the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. Disable the Web Client Service Until the patch can be applied, you may wish to disable the Web Client Service. To disable the Web Client Service service, follow these steps: Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel. Double-click Administrative Tools. Double-click Services. Double-click WebClient. In the Startup type list, click Disabled. Click Stop, and then click OK. Impact of Workaround: If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the \"Open as Web Folder\" functionality. Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at your firewall TCP ports 139 and 445 could be used to initiate a connection with the Web Client Service. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability through these ports. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports."
