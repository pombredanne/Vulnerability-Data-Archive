  "Description": "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - CVE-2015-2869 An attacker that can control the contents of certain file types may be able to cause an out-of-bounds read error in Total Commander File Plugin version 2.21 by specifying overly large values of certain properties. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may cause the Total Commander application to unexpectedly terminate. This attack has been noted in at least two different file types due to the software's improper use of the strncmp function. COFF Archive Library (.lib) files may be used by specifying overly large values for the 'Size' field of the Archive Member Header or the \"Number Of Symbols\" field in the 1st Linker Member. Linear Executable files may be used by specifying overly large values for the \"Resource Table Count\" field of the LE Header or the \"Object\" field at offset 0x8 from a \"Resource Table Entry\". Out-of-bounds reads may allow remote code execution in some circumstances; the CERT/CC is currently unaware of such an attack on the Total Commander File Info plugin, however.",
