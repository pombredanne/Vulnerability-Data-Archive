  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to deny security updates to users. Some package managers may permit an attacker to downgrade installed packages to versions with known vulnerabilities. Package manager functionality varies, so users are encouraged to check the systems affected portion of this document for more information about specific vendors.",

  "Overview": "Linux and Unix-based package managers may fail to expire signatures on package metadata. This could allow an attacker who controls a package repository to distrbute outdatted versions of various packages.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds for administrators and users\nUsing repositories that are maintained by operating system vendors and are not likely to be under the control of an attacker will mitigate this vulnerability. Administrators can use local repository mirroring tools such as apt-mirror and caches to remove the need for local clients to connect to untrusted mirrors when official repositories are under high bandwidth load. For packages that are important or exposed to the network (public facing SSH servers, etc) administrators should confirm with an out of band source, such as a vendor's security updates page, that they have the most recent version. Users should attempt to get security updates and other critical software packages from official or trusted mirrors. Workarounds for operating system vendors\nProviding users with statistics regarding how often third party mirrors are updated may help users avoid out-of-date mirrors. Distributing updates via bittorrent or other P2P protocol may allow package metadata to be distributed via an official mirror without excessive bandwidth load."
