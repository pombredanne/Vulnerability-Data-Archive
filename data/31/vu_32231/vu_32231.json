  "Resolution": "Organizations should weigh the risks presented by this vulnerability against their need to run Java applets. At the present time, an effective solution is to disable Java in Netscape. Historically, vulnerabilities of this type have not been widely exploited; however, this is not an indication that they can't be or that targeted attacks are not effective and possible. For organizations that have a need to run Java applets under their own control (that is, in situations where the HTML page referencing the applet is under their control), an alternate solution is to install a Java Runtime Environment Plugin available from Sun Microsystems. More information and pointers to downloadable software is available at \nhttp://java.sun.com/products/plugin/index.html To use this plugin effectively requires the use of a tool to convert HTML pages to use a different tag. Information about Sun's HTML Converter Software is also available on this page. This tool will rewrite HTML pages so that applets referenced in the page will run in the JRE provided by the plugin. To achieve protection from the resource reading vulnerability using this tool requires you to disable Java in the Netscape browser. The HTML Converter software will modify HTML pages to use an <EMBED> tag instead of an <APPLET>. The JRE plugin software recognizes the <EMBED> tag, and applets will then run within the new JRE plugin, instead of the default JRE provided by Netscape.",
