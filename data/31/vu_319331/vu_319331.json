  "Description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. Per Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-008: A response validation vulnerability exists in Windows DNS Server. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted queries to a DNS server so as to allow greater predictability of transaction IDs used by the DNS server and thus to redirect Internet traffic from legitimate locations.",
  "ID": "VU#319331",
  "IDNumber": "319331",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to insert arbitrary values in the DNS cache. An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.",
