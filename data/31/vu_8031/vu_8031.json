  "Description": "A setgid bin vulnerability in the Solstice Launcher utility\nbundled and automagically installed with the base operating system.\n\nVulnerability allows non-privileger users to quickly gain\nprivileged access.\n\nApplications launched from the Solstice Launcher have effective\ngroupid bin (#2). This applies to all launches including ones\nperformed by non-privileged users. Solstice Launcher allows\nusers to add their own applications thus giving out setgid bin\nto any user installed application.\n\nAUSCERT have verified this vulnerability.  It works very easily.\nThe binary program \"solstice\" which is vulnerable is shipped by part of\nthe Standard 2.5 distribution and does not require AdminSuite to have\nbeen installed.",
