  "Description": "McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.6.4 and earlier contains a pre-authenticated sql injection and directory path traversal vulnerability: Server-side pre-Authenticated SQL Injection within the Agent-Handler component (Agent-Server communication channel). The attack is performed by registering a rogue Agent to the ePolicy Orchestrator server, and sending a crafted HTTP request to the ePolicy Orchestrator server. Successful attacks allow remote attackers to retrieve sensitive information from the ePo database (such as administrative domain credentials), to create additional web console administrator accounts, and to perform remote code execution with SYSTEM privilege. CVE-2013-0140 Server-side pre-Authenticated Directory Path Traversal within File upload process. The attack is performed by registering a rogue Agent to the ePolicy Orchestrator server, and sending a crafted HTTP request to the ePolicy Orchestrator server. Successful attacks allow remote attackers to upload unrestricted file content. A typical scenario would be to store malicious files under /Software/ folder, to make them available for download from the ePolicy Orchestrator server. CVE-2013-0141\nThe CVSS scores below apply to CVE-2013-0140.",
