  "VendorStatement": "Subject:       XSS Vulnerability in Pubcookie Login Server\nAuthor:        Nathan Dors, Pubcookie Project\nStatus:        Confirmed, Patches Released\nThreat Class:  Cross-Site Scripting\nIssue date:    March 6, 2006\nSeverity:      Critical Summary: New releases of Pubcookie are available to address Cross-Site Scripting\n(XSS) vulnerabilities found in the Pubcookie login server. Sites running a Pubcookie login server are strongly advised to read this\nsecurity advisory and carry out the suggested actions below. Note: The URL for this security advisory is: http://pubcookie.org/news/20060306-login-secadv.html Background: XSS vulnerabilities typically involve three principals: a vulnerable Web\nsite, an attacker, and an end-user. The attacker exploits the\nvulnerability in the Web site such that script written by the attacker\nis run by the user within the security context of the Web site. XSS vulnerabilities can be classified as persistent or non-persistent,\ndepending on whether or not the script or HTML injected by the attacker\npersists on the vulnerable Web site. A persistent XSS vulerability allows the attacker to leave script or\nHTML on the vulnerable Web site where it has the potential of being run\nby multiple users without further involvement by the attacker. Blogs and\nmessage boards are example places where persistent XSS vulnerabilities\nare often exploited. A non-persistent XSS vulnerability, on the other hand, doesn't allow the\nattacker to stage script or HTML on the vulnerable Web site. Instead, he\nor she must stage it elsewhere and then orchestrate some other means of\ninitiating the attack, very often requiring the user's unintentional\ncooperation. Email, chat messages, and web pages are example places\nwhere script might be staged to help exploit a non-persistent XSS\nvulnerability. The user might trigger the attack simply by opening a\ntainted message or Web page, or by clicking inadvertently on a tainted\nlink. Pubcookie Login Server Details: Multiple non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities were found in the Pubcookie\nlogin server's compiled binary \"index.cgi\" CGI program. The CGI program\nmishandles untrusted data when printing responses to the browser. This\nmakes the program vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing\nscript or HTML. If an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to visit\ncarefully staged content, the attacker can use it to redirect the user\nto his or her local Pubcookie login page and attempt to exploit the XSS\nvulnerabilities. Threat Classification: These vulnerabilities are classified as *critical* due to the nature and\npurpose of the Pubcookie login server for user authentication and Web\nSingle Sign-on (SSO). Specific threats include: *) An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities\nmight steal senstive user data including a user's authentication\ncredentials (usernames and passwords); *) An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities\nmight steal private Pubcookie data including a user's authentication\nassertion (\"granting\") cookies and SSO (\"login\") session cookies; *) An attacker who injects HTML tags through the vulnerabilities might\ndeface a site's Pubcookie login page for a single visit by a single user\n(i.e. a non-persistent defacement). At the heart of these threats lies a violation of the user's trust in\nthe Pubcookie login server. Affected Versions: This advisory applies to all versions of the Pubcookie login server's\n\"index.cgi\" compiled binary CGI program. The following releases (including beta and final releases) are known to\nbe affected: 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.1a and 3.3.0. Patch Releases: The following patch releases address all known XSS vulnerabilities: * 3.3.0a (current production release)\n* 3.2.1b These releases are available now from the project's dowloads page: * http://pubcookie.org/downloads.html Patch files are also available for versions 3.3.0 and 3.2.1a from: * http://pubcookie.org/downloads/ Patch file names are: * pbc-login-server-security-fix-3_3_0-3_3_0a.patch\n* pbc-login-server-security-fix-3_2_1a-3_2_1b.patch Note: the login server security patch files include source code fixes\nfor the login server's \"index.cgi\" compiled binary CGI program and for\nseveral accompanying HTML template files. Suggested Action: All sites running a Pubcookie login server are strongly advised to\npursue the following course of action: 1) Sites using a 3.0 or 3.1 login server should upgrade to one of the\ncurrent patch releases. Version 3.3.0a (current production release) is\nrecommended. 2) Sites using a 3.2 login server should, at minimum, upgrade to the\npatched 3.2.1b release. Sites should also consider upgrading to 3.3.0a. 3) Sites using a 3.3 login server should upgrade to the patched 3.3.0a\nrelease. 4) Sites using locally modified versions of the login server should\napply and integrate the login server security patch that most closely\nmatches the local version. Note: For detailed version compatibility notes and upgrade information,\nconsult the relevant Pubcookie login server administration guide online. Project Response: * 18 Dec 2005: Vulnerabilities discovered. * 18 Dec 2005: Initial contact with technical details of vulnerability. * 18 Dec 2005: Initial response confirming exploit and severity. * 05 Jan 2006: Initial patches available for hardness testing. * 06 Feb 2006: Solutions available for all known vulnerabilities. * xx Mar 2006: Coordinated public release of security advisory.
