  "ID": "VU#916785",
  "IDNumber": "916785",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code as the user running the Snort process, usually root. The attacker does not need to send packets directly to the Snort sensor. It is sufficient to send packets to any of the hosts on the network monitored by Snort.",

  "Overview": "There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the RPC preprocessing feature of Snort versions 1.8 through 1.9.0 and 2.0 beta.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the rpc_decode preprocessor You can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by commenting out the rpc_decode preprocessor in the \"snort.conf\" configuration file. Note that this change may affect your ability to correctly process RPC record fragments. Block outbound packets from Snort IDS systems You may be able limit an attacker's capabilities if the system is compromised by blocking all outbound traffic from the Snort sensor. While this workaround will not prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, it may make it more difficult for the attacker to create a useful exploit."
