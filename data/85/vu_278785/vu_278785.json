  "Description": "The management tool transmits an unencrypted shared secret over the network to authenticate with clients. This traffic can then be used by an attacker to mimic a thin-manager server and control thin clients.",
  "ID": "VU#278785",
  "IDNumber": "278785",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "An attacker able to sniff traffic created by the management tool will be able to compromise the configuration of thin clients. An attacker may be able to exploit a buffer overflow in /usr/bin/tm-console-bin to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "The DevonIT management tool for thin clients uses a shared secret that is transmitted over the network in the clear. The /usr/bin/tm-console-bin application contains a buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
