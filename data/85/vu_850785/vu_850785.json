  "Workarounds": "Disable kcms_server Until patches are available and can be applied, disable the KCMS library service daemon by commenting out the appropriate entry in /etc/inetd.conf, terminating any currently running kcms_server processes, and restarting the Internet services daemon inetd(1M). The rpcinfo(1M), netstat(1M), and ps(1) commands may be useful in determining if the KCMS library service daemon is enabled. The following examples are from a SunOS 5.8 (Solaris 8) system: [/etc/inetd.conf] # Sun KCMS Profile Server 100221/1        tli     rpc/tcp wait root /usr/openwin/bin/kcms_server  kcms_server The KCMS library service is assigned RPC program number 100221. $ rpcinfo -p |grep 100221\n    100221    1   tcp  32781 $ netstat -a |grep 32781 *.32781                               Idle\n      *.32781              *.*                0      0 24576      0 LISTEN $ ps -ef |grep kcms_server root   484   156  0 15:12:01 ? 0:00 kcms_server As a general best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. Block or Restrict Access Until patches are available and can be applied, block or restrict access to the RPC portmapper service and the KCMS library service daemon from untrusted networks such as the Internet. The RPC portmapper service typically runs on ports 111/tcp and 111/udp. In the above example, the KCMS library service daemon is configured to run on 32781/tcp, however, this port number may vary. Also, consider blocking or restricting access to the ToolTalk database server (RPC program number 100083). Keep in mind that blocking ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable service from the internal network. It is important to understand your network configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate."
