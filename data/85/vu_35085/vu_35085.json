  "ID": "VU#35085",
  "IDNumber": "35085",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The contents of files may be disclosed to unauthorized remote users. Target files may be CGI scripts that contain sensitive configuration information such as database access credentials. This specific vulnerability does not allow an attacker to access files located outside the root directory of the web server.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) which could disclose sensitive information contained in CGI-type files. Typically a CGI/script file on a web server should only be executable and not readable by remote users. Sensitive information contained in such a file might include user credentials for access to a back-end database.",

  "Resolution": "Disable .HTR script mapping if not needed, as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-004: 1. Open the Internet Services Manager\n\t2. Right-click the web server, then choose Properties, then Master Properties, then WWW Service. 3. Choose Edit, then HomeDirectory, then Configuration\n\t4. Remove the .HTR entry\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in addition to .HTR, Microsoft also recommends removing several other so-called script mappings. Apply the appropriate vendor patch: IIS 4.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27492\nIIS 5.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27491\nNote that these are the most recent patches as referenced in MS01-004. CERT/CC also recommends the following documents on the secure configuration of Windows NT/2000 and IIS: Windows NT Configuration Guidelines\nWindows NT Security and Configuration Resources\nIIS 4.0 Security Checklist\nSecure Internet Information Services 5 Checklist",
