  "Description": "On all of these systems, Digital have added flags to\nmountd (-s and -d) which can be used to prevent clients outside the\nlocal domain from mounting filing systems. In simple tests\nthese appear to work.\n\nHowever there is a caching bug. If a request from a foreign\ndomain is rejected, and then tried again before the mount\ndaemon receives a request from a different client, the\ndomain check will be bypassed and the request will succeed",
  "ID": "VU#17585",
  "IDNumber": "17585",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This means that any site which relies on these flags to\nprovide NFS security is vulnerable to a client which tries\nits mount requests more than once.",

  "Workarounds": "The reporter has local fixes to mountd,\nbut in general the only workaround is to export to explicit\nlists of machines, which is not always feasible (DEC does\nnot support /etc/netgroups unless you run NIS, and there are\nline length limits in /etc/exports)."
