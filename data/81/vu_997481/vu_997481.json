  "Impact": "A remote attacker could derive private RSA keys. It is important to note that the attacks described in this paper appear to be practical under certain conditions. In the case of remote attacks against SSL/TLS-enabled web servers, variance in network latency must be sufficiently low (less than 1ms), and the attacker must account for other variables such as the load on the server. A server may be more vulnerable during a period of low activity. In the case of local interprocess attacks against a web server or a VM, all the necessary conditions exist.",

  "Overview": "Cryptographic libraries and applications do not provide adequate defense against a side-channel timing attack against RSA private keys. Such an attack has been shown to be practical using currently available hardware on systems and networks with sufficiently low variance in latency.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. The preferred defense against this attack is to use RSA blinding, however other methods such as quantizing may also be effective. RSA blinding incurs a slight performance penalty. If an application links to a library to perform RSA operations, it is necessary for the underlying cryptographic library to support RSA blinding and for the application to make use of it.",
