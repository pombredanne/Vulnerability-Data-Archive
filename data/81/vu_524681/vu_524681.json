  "Workarounds": "Disable the DWUpdateService ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {551E5190-19C7-4626-9D54-FB20355E6467} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{551E5190-19C7-4626-9D54-FB20355E6467}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0"
