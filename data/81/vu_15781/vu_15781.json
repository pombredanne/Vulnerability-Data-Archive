  "Description": "rpc.statd does a create or an unlink depending on the operation,\nthat is SM_MON (monitor) or SM_UNMON (unmonitor).  The file name to\nbe operated on is constructed by concatenating either \"/etc/sm/\" or\n\"/etc/sm.bak/\" with what the protocol assumes is the hostname but\nin fact can be what turns out to be a relative pathname relative to\nthe /etc/sm or /etc/sm.bak directory.  The exploit script then\nprepends ../.. to the filename argument given on the command line\nso that the file /vmunix given on the command line would become\n/etc/sm/../../vmunix.  /vmunix then would be removed.",
