  "Description": "Microsoft Windows supports a variety of font formats. One of which is the font library file format, which have the file extension of .FON. Rendering of font library files takes place in the Windows GDI (Graphics Device Interface), which is part of the Windows kernel-mode driver win32k.sys. Microsoft Windows contains a buffer overflow in the handling of font library files.",
  "ID": "VU#619281",
  "IDNumber": "619281",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to open a specially-crafted font library file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. A local use could also gain elevated privileges.",
