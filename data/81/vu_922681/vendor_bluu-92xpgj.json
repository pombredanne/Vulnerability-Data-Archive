The 3rd party library libupnp [1] used for this protocol is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows, as reported by CERT-CC [2]. These vulnerabilities allow DoS attacks and possibly remote code execution if the affected network ports are reachable by an attacker. Siemens plans to provide official permanent fixes with upcoming firmware updates and product replacements, and describes a temporary workaround below.
