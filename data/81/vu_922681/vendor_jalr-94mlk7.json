  "VendorStatement": "| Teldat Security Bulletin | Bulletin ID: 2013-02-04\nRevision: 1.0 Title: Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) contains multiple buffer overflows in SSDP\n(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#922681) Summary: US-CERT Note VU#922681 describes that the \"Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp\" library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use \"libupnp\" may also accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface, therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service. Details can be found at http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681 and https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150 Comment: The UPnP implemention used in the BOSS operating system is a proprietary solution developed by Teldat, and no Teldat product running the BOSS operating system is affected. Note that products sold under the former company name of \"Funkwerk Enterprise Communications\" - if running the BOSS operating system - are equally not affected by this vulnaerablity.
