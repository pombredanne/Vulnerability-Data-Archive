  "Description": "The HP Software Distributor (SD-UX) is a package that provides a user\ninterface which can be used to install, update, remove, and package HP-UX\nsoftware and patches.\n\nThe programs supplied with this package create files in an insecure\nmanner.  As these programs execute with root privileges, it is possible\nto create or over-write arbitrary files on the system.  The default\nlocation of the programs supplied by the package is /usr/sbin.",

  "Workarounds": "Until official patches are available sites are encouraged to completely\nprevent the execution of all vulnerable SD-UX programs by any user\n(including root). # chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swinstall\n# chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swmodify Note that if only the setuid permissions are removed, it is still\npossible for users to gain the privileges of any user executing\nthe SD-UX programs (including root). Or one of the following 1 Run in single user mode If packages must be installed, the machine should be brought into\nsingle-user mode, execute permissions re-enabled on\n/usr/sbin/swinstall, # chmod 700 /usr/sbin/swinstall\n# chmod 700 /usr/sbin/swmodify and all symbolic links in /var/tmp and /tmp removed. The following\ncommand can be used to remove the symbolic links: # find /tmp /var/tmp -type l -ok rm {} \\; Once this has been completed, any software package maintenance may be\nsafely performed. The execute permissions on the vulnerable programs must be removed\nbefore the machine is brought back into multi-user mode. # chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swinstall\n# chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swmodify 2. Change temporary file environment variable This workaround should only be used if the SD-UX programs must be used\nwhile the machine is in multi-user mode. The SD-UX programs use a number of temporary files. The location of\nthese files can be configured using the environment variable TMPDIR. It is possible to set the environment variable TMPDIR to a non-world\nwritable directory. Having the temporary files created in a non-world\nwritable directory prevents the exploitation of the vulnerability\ndescribed in this advisory. NOTE:  The environment variable must be set in each login\nsession BEFORE any SD-UX programs are used. To use this method, the following steps must be taken: 1) As root, create a non-world writable temporary directory for the\ntemporary files used by the SD-UX programs. The location of these\ntemporary files can be configured with the TMPDIR environment variable. In this workaround, we have chosen to use the directory\n/var/tmp/SD_tmp. # mkdir /var/tmp/SD_tmp\n# chmod 700 /var/tmp/SD_tmp For this workaround to be effective, sites should ensure that the\nparent directory of $TMPDIR has the sticky bit set if the parent\ndirectory is world writable. In this workaround, /var/tmp is the\ndirectory concerned. The sticky bit on /var/tmp can be set with the\ncommand: # chmod 1777 /var/tmp In all sessions where software maintenance is performed: 2) Change permissions on the vulnerable programs: # chmod 700 /usr/sbin/swinstall\n# chmod 700 /usr/sbin/swmodify 3) Set the environment variable TMPDIR: (under csh) # setenv TMPDIR /var/tmp/SD_tmp (under sh) # TMPDIR=/var/tmp/SD_tmp; export TMPDIR and verify that the directory exists and is writable by root. # ls -ld $TMPDIR 4) Perform any software package maintenance. 5) Remove the execute permissions on the vulnerable programs: # chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swinstall\n# chmod 400 /usr/sbin/swmodify 6) The environment variable TMPDIR is used by many other programs. You should either exit this interactive session, or reset the\nTMPDIR environment variables before continuing. NOTE:  Steps 2) through 6) must be repeated each time software\nmaintenance is performed."
