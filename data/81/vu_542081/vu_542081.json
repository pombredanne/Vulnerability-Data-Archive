  "Impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that processed the request. In the case of a web server, or other service, this is likely to be SYSTEM, or another account with elevated privileges. In the case of a client application, or other service, this is the account used to view the web page.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor. Microsoft has released a patch (Q329414) and Security Bulletin MS02-065 to address this issue. An end-user version of the document is available at http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms02-065.asp. Note that a vulnerable version of the control may be installed on a Windows system that never had the vulnerable control installed prior to the patch being applied. This is due to the fact that the vulnerable ActiveX control is signed by Microsoft and the patch does not set the kill bit for the MDAC control.",
