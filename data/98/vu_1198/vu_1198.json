  "Description": "Background:\nThe Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an\nInternet standard protocol developed to manage nodes on an IP\nnetwork.\n\nProblem:\nThe default configuration of the Windows NT implementation\nof SNMP is insecure.  The SNMP community name is, by default,\nset as \"public\".  This community name is used much like an account\nor password to limit SNMP functionality to authorized users.  Also,\nthe community name is stored as plaintext in the NT registry,\nreadable by all local users.\n\nUsing the facilities made available by this SNMP it is possible to\ngain intelligence about user accounts on a system via the SAM,\nand also to delete IP/BIOS address mapping information in the\nWINS.  The information made available from these two databases\nis defined in the LanManager II MIB.",

  "Impact": "An unauthorized user can gain intelligence about the user base of a\nsystem by issuing the appropriate SNMP get commands, and also\ndelete information from the WINS database through issuing the\nappropriate SNMP set commands.",
