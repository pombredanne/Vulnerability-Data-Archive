It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nthat these measures be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.\n\nThis issue will be corrected in future releases of IRIX.\n\n\n- ---------------\n- ---- Impact ---\n- ---------------\n\nThe NetWare Client 1.0 software subsystem is installed by default on IRIX 6.3.\n\nA user account on the vulnerable system is required in order to exploit\nNetWare Client 1.0 locally and remotely which can lead to root access.\n\nThis vulnerability has been publically discussed in Usenet newsgroups\nand mailing lists.\n\n\n- ---------------------------\n- ---- Temporary Solution ---\n- ---------------------------\n\nAlthough patches are available for this issue, it is realized that\nthere may be situations where installing the patches immediately may\nnot be possible.\n\nThe steps below can be used to remove the vulnerability by removing\nthe permissions of the NetWare Client 1.0 programs.\n\n\n\n     1) Become the root user on the system.\n\n                % /bin/su -\n                Password:\n                #\n\n\n     2) Verify a vulnerable NetWare Client 1.0 software subsystem is installed.\n        Only NetWare Client 1.0 on IRIX 6.3 is vulnerable.\n\n                #  versions -b netwr_client\n                I = Installed, R = Removed\n\n                   Name                 Date      Description\n                I  netwr_client         04/30/97  NetWare Client 1.0\n\n\n     3) Change the permissions on the vulnerable NetWare Client 1.0 programs.\n\n                # /bin/chmod 500 /usr/etc/netware/ipxchk\n                # /bin/chmod 500 /usr/etc/netware/ipxlink\n\n\n     4) Verify the new permissions on the program.\n        Note that the program sizes may be different depending on release.\n\n                # ls -l /usr/etc/netware/ipxchk\n                -r-x------ 1 root   sys   9076 Feb 18 13:50 ipxchk\n\n                # ls -l /usr/etc/netware/ipxlink\n                -r-x------ 1 root   sys  21412 Feb 18 13:50 ipxlink\n\n     5) Return to previous user level.\n\n                # exit\n                $\n\n\n- -----------------\n- ---- Solution ---\n- -----------------\n\n   OS Version     Vulnerable?
