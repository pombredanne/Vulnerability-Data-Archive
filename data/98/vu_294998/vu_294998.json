  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service condition or potentially execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on a vulnerable system. According to the eEye Digital Security Advisory, in order for this vulnerability to be exploited, the firewall must be configured to allow NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) traffic. This configuration is not present by default.",

  "Resolution": "Apply Patch\nSymantec recommends that clients running corporate versions of the affected products apply patches obtained through their appropriate support channels. Use LiveUpdate\nSymantec recommends that clients running consumer versions of the affected products use the LiveUpdate feature to ensure all updates are installed. According to Symantec, this can be done as follows: Open any installed Symantec product\nClick on LiveUpdate in the toolbar\nRun LiveUpdate until Symantec LiveUpdate indicated that all installed Symantec products are up-to-date\nDepending on the application, system may require a reboot to effectively update available fixes",
