  "Addendum": "Source: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=370206 Posted By: rizzo\nDate: 2004-04-21 10:47\nSummary: phpwsBB 0.9.2 Released \nphpwsBB is a native bulletin board module for the phpWebSite content manage system, version 0.9.3-2 or later. It features thread monitoring and administration, including marking threads sticky, locking threads, and forking messages off to new threads. This release fixes a pseudo-security hole that would allow an anonymous user to use the Search system to view message labels (and _only_ the labels) even if anonymous viewing was turned off. Thanks to Stephen Adler for reporting it. I recommend upgrading ASAP if you are hard-core and not allowing anonymous viewing. http://phpwsbb.sourceforge.net Source: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=370315\nPosted By: rizzo\nDate: 2004-04-21 20:24\nSummary: phpwsContacts 0.8.3 Released \nphpwsContacts is a module for the phpWebSite CMS 0.9.3-2 or higher. It provides extended user contact information, CSV exporting and vCard exporting/importing. Suggested uses are for corporate addressbooks or alumni websites. Fixed a security hole that allowed anonymous people to export the CSV file regardless of allow_anon_view setting. Also made more fields available for browse templates for those people wanting to customize it. http://phpwscontacts.sourceforge.net",
