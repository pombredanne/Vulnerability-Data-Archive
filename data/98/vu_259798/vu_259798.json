  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, potentially compromising an entire Kerberos realm. An unsuccessful attack against this heap corruption vulnerability may result in a denial of service by crashing the KDC process. According to the MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2005-002, this vulnerability affects the KDC implementation in all MIT krb5 releases supporting TCP client connections to the KDC. This includes krb5-1.3 and later releases, up to and including krb5-1.4.1.",

  "Overview": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) to free unallocated memory, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",

  "Resolution": "Apply patches available from your vendor. Details of the patch are also available from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2005-002-patch_1.4.1.txt. If patching can not be performed in a timely manner you could consider disabling TCP support in the KDC to avoid this vulnerability.",
