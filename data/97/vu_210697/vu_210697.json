  "Workarounds": "Disable the vulnerable ImageKit ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer The vulnerable ImageKit ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {87CDBE22-FBF6-11D2-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9} {EF2E3685-201D-11D3-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9} {FF8676C3-11ED-11D3-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{87CDBE22-FBF6-11D2-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{EF2E3685-201D-11D3-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{FF8676C3-11ED-11D3-B1B0-00E0290EA3C9}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities.
