  "Description": "Script to exploit a problem with Digital Unix crontab program.\nTested with DU 3.2.  When crontab -e runs, it makes a copy of your\ncrontab file in /tmp and calls your editor with the name of that\nfile. If your \"editor\" simply deletes the tmp file and replaces it\nwith a symbolic link to any file on the system, crontab will\nprocess the file that is linked to. Since crontab seems to process\nthe file as root, it will be able to follow the link and read the\nfile. As crontab processes the file, any line that is not in the\ncrontab format will be printed out with an error message. Hence\ngetting around normal permissions on files to read their contents.",
