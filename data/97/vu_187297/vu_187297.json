  "ID": "VU#187297",
  "IDNumber": "187297",
  "IPProtocol": "UDP",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a vulnerable DNS server perform recursion. This could be used to perform denial-of-service attacks. An attacker may also be able to querry the cache.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ISC",
    "BIND",
    "default ACLs"
  ],
  "Overview": "ISC (Internet Systems Consortiuim) BIND fails to properly set default access control lists. This may allow unauthorized users to make recursive querries and querry the cache.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch\nThis issue is addressed in ISC BIND 9.2.8-P1, BIND 9.3.4-P1, BIND 9.4.1-P1 or BIND 9.5.0a6. Users who obtain BIND from their operating system vendor should see the systems affected portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds for administrators of non-publicly accessisble recursive DNS servers \nUsing firewall rules, limit access to the DNS server to authorized networks. Workarounds for administrators of publicly accessisble recursive DNS servers \nRate limiting the number of external recursion requests may mitigate potential abuse of the DNS server."
