  "IDNumber": "446897",
  "IPProtocol": "udp",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the CUPS server or cause the server to crash. The cupsd daemon may run with root privileges.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Restricting access to CUPS servers by using the CUPS configuration directives, firewall rules, or access control lists may mitigate this vulnerability. By default, cupsd listens on port 631/udp. Systems that use CUPS exclusively for local printing should set the Listen directive to localhost:631 in the cupsd configuration file to prevent remote systems from exploiting this vulnerability."
