  "Description": "from auscert advisory:\n\nDue to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\npasswd program while it is executing.  By supplying a carefully\ndesigned argument to the passwd program, intruders may be able to\nforce passwd to execute arbitrary commands.  As passwd is setuid\nroot, it may allow intruders to run arbitrary commands with root\nprivileges.\n\nfollow-up from auscert:\n\nWe stated that under Solaris 2.4, yppasswd, nispasswd and passwd were all\nhardlinks to each other (as they are under Solaris 2.5).  This is incorrect\nand they are in fact separate programs.  Applying the wrapper, as\nrecommended in the advisory, will address the problem for passwd under\nboth Solaris 2.4 and Solaris 2.5/2.5.1.  At this stage we are unsure\nwhether the buffer overrun exists in yppasswd under Solaris 2.4.  If it\ndoes, the wrapper will have to be applied to this program separately under\nSolaris 2.4.\n\nnispasswd is not setuid root under Solaris 2.4 and hence not exploitable\nwith this vulnerability.  We have no information about earlier releases\nof Solaris at this stage.\n\nAt this stage we are unsure of the full implications of this error, but\nwill be issuing an updated version early next week.\n\nUntil this updated version is released, could all teams please refrain\nfrom re-distributing this advisory.\n\n\nExploit information involving this vulnerability has been made\npublicly available.\n\npasswd, yppasswd and nispasswd under Solaris 2.x are located by\ndefault in /usr/bin/.",

  "Workarounds": "This\nwrapper, including installation instructions, can be found at: ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/tools/overflow_wrapper.c This wrapper replaces the passwd program and checks the length of the\ncommand line arguments which are passed to it. If an argument exceeds\na certain predefined value (MAXARGLEN), the wrapper exits without\nexecuting the passwd command. The wrapper program can also be\nconfigured to syslog any failed attempts to execute passwd with\narguments exceeding MAXARGLEN. For further instructions on using this\nwrapper, please read the comments at the top of overflow_wrapper.c. Applying this wrapper program to passwd, following the instructions\ngiven in the comments at the start of the wrapper program, will also\nfix the overflow problems with yppasswd and nispasswd, since these\nprograms are merely hard links to passwd."
