  "Description": "Dell System Detect (DSD) is an application that runs on your Windows-based PC or Tablet with your permission and interacts with the Dell Support website. DSD is pre-installed on some Dell systems. DSD installs a trusted root certificate (DSDTestProvider) that includes the private key. Dell systems that have been re-imaged or do not otherwise have DSD installed are not affected.",
  "ID": "VU#925497",
  "IDNumber": "925497",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can generate certificates signed by the DSDTestProvider CA. Systems that trusts the DSDTestProvider CA will trust any certificate issued by the CA. An attacker can impersonate web sites and other services, sign software and email messages, and decrypt network traffic and other data. Common attack scenarios include impersonating a web site, performing a MiTM attack to decrypt HTTPS traffic, and installing malicious software.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "Dell System Detect installs the DSDTestProvider certificate into theTrusted Root Certificate Store on Microsoft Windows systems. The certificate includes the private key. This allows attackers to create trusted certificates and perform impersonation, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and passive decryption attacks, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.",

  "Resolution": "Mark DSDTestProvider certificate as untrusted Mark Revoke the DSDTestProvider certificate. Using the Windows certificate manager (certmgr.msc), move the DSDTestProvider certificate from the Trusted Root Certificate Store  to Untrusted Certificates. Revoking the certificate helps prevent reinstating trust if DSD is reinstalled. Remove DSDTestProvider certificate Dell has issued guidance to remove the DSDTestProvider certificate in this blog post. Administrators can Configure Trusted Roots and Disallowed Certificates for managed systems. Update Certified Trust List Microsoft Security Advisory 3119884 documents updates to the Certified Trust List (CTL) to mark the DSDTestProvider certificate as untrusted. Most Windows systems will automatically receive the updated CTL.",
