  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute SQL queries on a server, possibly with elevated privileges. As a result, attackers may be able to view or modify the contents of a WebEOC database, including authentication and sensitive medical information.",
  "Keywords": [
    "WebEOC SQL Injection",
    "Database",
    "arbitrary code"
  ],
  "Overview": "WebEOC contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that may allow attackers to execute sql queries, potentially viewing or modifying data, or executing database commands.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade \nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: Specific validation checks have been added to all input fields that appeared to be susceptible to SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks to protect input fields against SQL injection or XSS attempts. In addition, all function parameters are validated in the application business logic. The validation process replaces ' with '' for String parameters, and for numeric parameters it verifies that the parameter is numeric. Such checks are a good first line of defense against SQL injection attacks. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
