  "IDNumber": "489397",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send specially-crafted SMB packets to a vulnerable host may be able to execute arbitrary code on that system. The attacker-supplied code would be run in the context of Local System, resulting in a complete compromise of the system.",

  "Workarounds": "Utilize Workarounds Microsoft recommends the following workarounds in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-027: Block TCP ports 139 and 445. This will disallow attackers the ability to contact the vulnerable SMB service on the affected host(s). Use a firewall to block unsolicited or malicious traffic. Use IPsec to protect network communications between hosts."
