  "Description": "From Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS98-004)\n\nA web client connecting to an IIS server can use the RDS DataFactory\nobject to direct that server to access data using an installed OLE DB\nprovider. This includes executing SQL calls to ODBC-compliant databases using\nthe ODBC drivers installed on the server.\n \nFor example a web-client could issue a SQL command along with the name or IP address of a remote SQL server, a SQL account and password, database name, and a SQL query string. If the request is valid (remote server is reachable by the IIS server, user account and password are correct, database name is valid), the query results will be sent via HTTP back to the client. While it is true that this requires significant inside information, the potential accessibility of this information should not be underestimated, as organizations that don't follow good security practices could have blank or easy to guess passwords on their SQL administrator accounts. The RDS DataFactory object along with other installed ODBC drivers opens other possibilities, including possible access to non-published files on the IIS server.\n \nThe vulnerability caused by the DataFactory is even greater if some newer OLE DB Providers are installed on the server. \"Microsoft DataShape Provider\" and \"Microsoft JET OLE DB provider\" (which ship with MDAC 2.0 in Visual Studio 98) allow shell commands to be executed. If the DataFactory is enabled on such a server, Internet clients can use these providers to execute shell commands, which can potentially bring down the server or\notherwise severely affect its performance.",
