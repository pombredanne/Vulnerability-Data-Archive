  "Impact": "The consequences of exploitation are unclear, but may include improper program termination of the web browser process, and unstable/unpredictable behavior in the web browser. In addition, many of these vulnerabilites may be triggered by accessing or viewing a specially crafted image. In these cases, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a victim to access a malicious image file.",

  "Overview": "Numerous vulnerabilities have been reported in image parsing routines of multiple web browsers. The impacts of these vulnerabilities is unclear, but may include improper termination of the web browser process or cause the  web browser to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.",

  "Workarounds": "The following guidelines will help to prevent exploitation as a result of accessing a malicious image files. Do Not Accept Image Files from Unknown or Untrusted Sources Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted image files. By only accessing image files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. Read and send email in plain text format Many mail clients can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
