  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow Watchguard Extensible Threat Management (XTM) version 11.7.4 and possibly earlier versions contain a buffer overflow vulnerability when reading large cookie requests. Remote administration is enabled by default on TCP/8080 for the virtual appliances (XTMv). The physical XTM appliances do not have this feature enabled by default. WGagent is one of the processes running on the XTM appliance, which is responsible for parsing web cookies sent to the appliance\u2019s web management interface. By creating a maliciously crafted cookie that contains an arbitrarily large sessionid value and connecting to the XTM appliance\u2019s web management interface, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute code on the appliance. The WGagent process runs with low privileges and from a chroot jail, but it does have enough privilege to access the configuration file and change passwords.",
