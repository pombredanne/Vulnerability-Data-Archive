  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker with the ability to send a crafted packet to the DHCPD listening port (typically port 67/UDP), may be able to crash the ISC DHCP daemon, causing a denial of service. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server with the privileges of the DHCPD process (typically root).",

  ],
  "Overview": "The Internet Systems Consortium's (ISC) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 3 application contains a vulnerability that introduces several potential buffer overflow conditions. Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service condition to the DHCP Daemon (DHCPD) and may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the DHCPD process.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "ISC has released DHCP 3.0.1rc14 which resolves this issue. For systems that do not support vsnprintf(), DHCP now implements it's own bounded function. DHCP will not compile and link if it does not believe that it is linking to a bounds checking function. Versions prior to ISC DHCP 3 are no longer supported. All users of ISC DHCP are encouraged to update to the latest version.",
