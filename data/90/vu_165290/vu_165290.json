  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nVersion 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi: These vulnerabilities have been addressed in WebEOC version 6.0.2. Each of the application areas that exposed sensitive information were modified so that the sensitive information is no longer exposed. Much of this sensitive information was moved to different parts of the application and stored on the server in areas that are only accessible to authenticated/trusted users. A general policy has been implemented that reduces the amount of information that is passed between the client and the server, thus reducing the likelihood that sensitive information would be transmitted in an insecure manner. To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi Technical Support.",
