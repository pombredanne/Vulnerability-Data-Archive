  "Overview": "Hushmail.com contains a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. An attacker can send a specially crafted email message to a victim containing malicious scripting (JavaScript, VBScript, JScript, etc.), active content, or potentially HTML. When a victim views the message with scripting enabled, the victim's browser may then interpret scripting in the message which can lead to several impacts. Likewise, a victim may follow a link that exploits this vulnerability.",
