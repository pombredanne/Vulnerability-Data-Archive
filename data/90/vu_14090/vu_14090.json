  "Description": "The cgi-bin program \"handler\" is supposed to offer a captive\nservice where users can read and download files.  It carries out a\ncheck on the supplied filename to ensure that the file is in the\npath that is supposed to be publically accessible.\n\nHowever, the script only checks for \"..\" in the pathname, not other\ncharacters such as \";\".  Therefore by crafting the appropriate POST\ninstruction, a remote user can induce this script to run arbitrary\ncommands.",

  "IDNumber": "14090",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Remote users can run arbitrary commands on the victim system as the\nuser-id of the httpd.",
