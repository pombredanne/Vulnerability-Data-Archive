  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary script as the administrator of the server by embedding <SCRIPT> tags in URL requests that are subsequently viewed in the administration client. Because the administrator has authenticated to the server via the administration client at the time the malicious script is executed, the malicious script can take administration actions on the server, including starting or stopping the server. Attackers may also be able to perform other server administration actions.",
