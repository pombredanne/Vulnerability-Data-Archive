  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. The Oracle Web Cache may run as SYSTEM on Windows NT and Windows 2000 systems.",

  "Overview": "The CERT/CC is aware of a report about \"several remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Oracle Web Cache Server\" that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Web Cache process.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Where possible, limit access to vulnerable systems to trusted users, hosts, and networks. The report from NGSSoftware states that \"In the interim Oracle customers can protect against this problem by ensuring that the administration pages for web cache have been protected by changing the default administrator password.\"  This implies that the vulnerabilities may exist in the Oracle Web Cache Manager, a web-based management interface that listens for administration and configuration requests on port 4000/tcp by default. Oracle Web Cache also listens for cache invalidation requests on 4001/tcp and statistics monitoring requests on 4002/tcp. The Oracle Technology Network (registration required) contains documentation on the Oracle Web Cache Manager, including instructions for changing the default administrator password, setting trusted administrative hosts and networks, changing the user and group IDs used by the Web Cache process on UNIX/Linux systems, and changing the default administration port. Disable Unnecessary Services If your site does not use the Oracle Web Cache, disable it. Use Least Privilege Run the Oracle Web Cache under a user account with the least privilege possible. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation, but may limit the impact of an attack."
