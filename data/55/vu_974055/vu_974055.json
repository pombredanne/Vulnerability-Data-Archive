  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-6542\nThe iTrack device tracking ID number is the device's BLE MAC address. It can be obtained by being in range of the device. CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency -  CVE-2016-6543\nA captured MAC/device ID can be registered under multiple user accounts allowing access to getgps GPS data, which can allow unauthenticated parties to track the device. CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2016-6544\ngetgps data can be modified without authentication by setting the data using the parametercmd:setothergps. This vulnerability can be exploited to alter the GPS data of a lost device. CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration - CVE-2016-6545\nSession cookies are not used for maintaining valid sessions. The user's password is passed as a POST parameter over HTTPS using a base64 encoded passwd field on every request. CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk - CVE-2016-6546\nThe iTrack Easy mobile application stores the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API in base64-encoding in the cache.db file. The base64 encoding format is considered equivalent to cleartext. The CVSS Score below represents CVE-2016-6544",
