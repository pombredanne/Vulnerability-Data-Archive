  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system with the privileges of the current user.",
  "Keywords": "OpenSSL",
  "Overview": "OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in OpenSSL clients that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the client's system.",
