  "Description": "The @Mail Open 1.04 webmail client contains multiple vulnerabilities including the following. CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\nAn attacker can upload files attached to email letters with dangerous types, such as, .php. This vulnerability can be exploited to upload a backdoor php shell. CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\nThe compose.php script contains a directory traversal vulnerability. An example is below: hxxps://localhost/compose.php?func=renameattach&unique=/..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././tmp/positive.test%00&Attachment[]=/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\nThe compose.php and SendMsg.php scripts can be exploited with the directory traversal attack to copy any file on the system. An example is below: hxxps://localhost/compose.php?func=renameattach&unique=1.txt%00&Attachment[]=/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd As a result, the file will be available at: hxxps://localhost/tmp/username@host.com/username@host.com-1.txt The mime.php script can be exploited with the directory traversal attack to read any file on the system. An example is below: hxxps://localhost/mime.php?file=%0A/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&name=positive.html CWE-200: Information Exposure\nThe info.php script calls the phpinfo() function that my display sensitive system configuration information. Additional details may be found in Positive Technologies' PT-2011-48 advisory.",
