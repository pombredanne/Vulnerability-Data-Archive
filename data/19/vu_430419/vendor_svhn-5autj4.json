SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for\nneutralizing the exposure. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be\nimplemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems. These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of\nIRIX. - --- Impact --- The rpc.passwd binary is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems. It is\npart of the optional subsystem \"nfs.sw.nis\". To see if rpc.passwd is installed, execute the following command: # versions nfs.sw.nis\n  I = Installed, R = Removed Name                 Date        Description I  nfs                  03/26/2002  Network File System, 6.5.16m\n     I  nfs.sw               03/26/2002  NFS Software\n     I  nfs.sw.nis           03/26/2002  NIS (formerly Yellow Pages) Support If the line containing \"nfs.sw.nis\" is returned, then it is installed and\nthe system is potentially vulnerable. This vulnerability applies only to\nsystems that are configured as YP masters (\"chkconfig yp\" shows \"on\", and\n\"ps -ef | grep rpc.passwd\" shows that rpc.passwd is running). To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following\ncommand: # uname -R That will return a result similar to the following: # 6.5 6.5.15f The first number (\"6.5\") is the release name, the second (\"6.5.15f\" in this\ncase) is the extended release name. The extended release name is the\n\"version\" we refer to throughout this document. This vulnerability was assigned the following CVE: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0357 - --- Temporary Workaround --- SGI understands that there are times when upgrading the operating system or\ninstalling patches are inconvenient or not possible. In those instances, we\nrecommend the following workaround, although it may have a negative impact\non the functionality of the system: Disable the rpc.passwd binary by issuing the following command: # chmod 444 /usr/etc/rpc.passwd\n  # killall rpc.passwd After doing this, it will be necessary to run the \"passwd\" program on the\n  NIS master in order to cause NIS password changes. Instead of using this workaround, SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX\n6.5.16 when released, or installing the appropriate patch from the listing\nbelow. We recommend this course of action because IRIX 6.5.16 and the patch\nalso fix other non security-related issues with rpc.passwd. - --- Solution --- SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our\nrecommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.16 when available, or install the\nappropriate patch. OS Version     Vulnerable?
