  "Description": "Problem Description: attacker has been targeting\nspecific ISP's with sequential TCP SYN probes which originate from\nconsistently changing, random, and sometimes unreachable source addresses\nand port numbers. The attacks, thus far, have been targeted at UNIX hosts\nwhich reside within the ISP's interior network (such as DNS, mail hosts,\netc.), but it stands to reason that the same attack method could be\ntargeted at the router(s).",
  "ID": "VU#2319",
  "IDNumber": "2319",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Systems providing TCP-based services to the Internet community may be unable to provide those services while under attack and for some time after the attack ceases. The service itself is not harmed by the attack; usually only the ability to provide the service is impaired. In some cases, the system may exhaust memory, crash, or be rendered otherwise inoperative.",

  "Overview": "Hosts implementing the TCP/IP protocol are vulnerable to a type of denial-of-service attack known as a SYN Flood. This information was first published by the CERT/CC in CERT Advisory CA-1996-21.",

  "Resolution": "Use SYN Cookies SYN Cookies allow hosts under attack to drop incoming TCP connection requests that originate from spoofed IP addresses. Many operating systems provide an implementation of SYN Cookies; please consult your OS vendor or documentation for information on enabling this feature. For general information on SYN Cookies, please see http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html.",

  "Workarounds": "Filter IP Traffic With the current IP protocol technology, it is impossible to eliminate IP-spoofed packets. However, you can take steps to reduce the number of IP-spoofed packets entering and exiting your network. Currently, the best method is to install a filtering router that restricts the input to your external interface (known as an input filter) by not allowing a packet through if it has a source address from your internal network. In addition, you should filter outgoing packets that have a source address different from your internal network to prevent a source IP spoofing attack from originating from your site. The combination of these two filters would prevent outside attackers from sending you packets pretending to be from your internal network. It would also prevent packets originating within your network from pretending to be from outside your network. These filters will *not* stop all TCP SYN attacks, since outside attackers can spoof packets from *any* outside network, and internal attackers can still send attacks spoofing internal addresses. We strongly urge Internet service providers to install these filters in your routers. In addition, we strongly recommend customers of Internet service providers to contact your service provider to verify that the necessary filters are in place to protect your network."
