  "VendorStatement": "On October 16th, 2017, a research paper with the title of \"Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2\" was made publicly available. This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key. Risk Rating:\u00a0High Affected Products:\u00a0Our investigations indicate that currently only Barracuda NextGen Firewall Wi-Fi Models used under Wi-Fi Client mode are affected: F101 F201 F301 F80 F82.DSLA F82.DSLB F180 F183 F280 FSC1"
