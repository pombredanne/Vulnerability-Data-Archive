Development snapshots of 2.4.1 and 2.3.5 containing fixes for the issue are available for those who need to obtain the corrections before the official release. These snapshots were fixed as soon as corrections were made available from the FreeBSD project upstream on October 17th.

The official releases of 2.4.1 and 2.3.5 will be announced on our blog at https://www.netgate.com/blog/ and on social media."
