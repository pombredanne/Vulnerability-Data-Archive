  "VendorStatement": "10/18/2017 Security advisory for the vulnerabilities of WPA2 protocol\nASUS is aware of the recent WPA2 vulnerability issue. We take your security and privacy seriously and are currently working towards a full solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we want to help clarify the severity of the potential threat, and let our valued customers know the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid or lessen the threat of being compromised. Your devices are only vulnerable if an attacker is in physical proximity to your wireless network and is able to gain access to it. This exploit cannot steal your banking information, passwords, or other data on a secured connection that utilizes proper end-to-end encryption. However, an attacker could capture and read this information on an unsecured connection via an exploited WiFi network. Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible for the attacker to redirect network traffic, send invalid data to devices or even inject malware into the network. We are feverishly working with chipset suppliers to resolve this vulnerability and will release patched firmware for affected routers in the near future. Before this patched firmware is released, here are a few cautions all users should take: (1) Avoid public Wi-Fi and Hotspots until the routers and your devices are updated. Use cellular network connections if possible. (2) Only connect to secured services that you trust or have been verified. Web pages that use HTTPS or another secure connection will include HTTPS in the URL. If the connection is secured using TLS 1.2 your activities with that service is safe for now. (3) Keep your operating system and antivirus software up-to-date. Microsoft recently updated Windows to fix this exploit on their latest operating systems. Google and Apple are following suit shortly. (4) When in doubt, be safe and use your cellular network or a wired connection (Ethernet) to access the internet. This exploit only affects 802.11 traffic between a Wi-Fi router and a connected device on an exploited WiFi connection."
