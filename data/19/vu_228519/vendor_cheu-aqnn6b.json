  "VendorStatement": "AmpliFi line products are not affected since firmware v2.4.3. Firmware v2.4.2 is partially affected and all versions prior to that are affected. All airMAX AC and M series products have fixes for the majority of WPA2 rekeying issues since v8.4.0 (AC series) and v6.0.7 (M series). Additional improvements will fully resolve the issue with v8.4.2/v6.1.2. Furthermore, our proprietary airMAX protocol makes simple attacks more difficult.
