  "Description": "CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature The Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC fails to properly check for valid signatures in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) included with the Kerberos ticket request. A domain user may forge the information contained in the PAC to request higher user privileges than should be allowed. Since the KDC does not verify the signature correctly, it will award the user the requested privileges, effectively making the user a domain administrator and allowing complete compromise of the entire domain. The Microsoft Research Security and Defense Blog has a more technical description of the vulnerability.",
