  "Impact": "Prior to the server side change, an attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code by sending malicious messages to the victim via the AIM messaging service. Attackers may still be able to compromise vulnerable versions of the client software in specific circumstances where the attacker has control of local DNS information, the ability to sniff your AIM session, or control of a proxy between the client and the AIM server.",

  "Overview": "There is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). An exploit has been publicly released. AOL has implemented a server side fix that has largely eliminated the chances of widespread automated exploitation of the vulnerability, but targeted exploitation of specific clients may still be possible. Attackers that are able to exploit the vulnerability may be able to execute arbitrary code.",

  "Workarounds": "Block AIM Authentication at the Firewall Blocking connections to login.oscar.aol.com on port 5190/tcp may prevent users on the local network from authenticating to the AIM server. This may be sufficient to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. Block Untrusted Messages AIM permits the user to only accept messages from known peers. By enabling this feature, you may be able to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. Note that you may still be vulnerable to attacks that originate from known peers if the vulnerability is exploited in a worm like fashion."
