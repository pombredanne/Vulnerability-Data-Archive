  "Description": "Solarwinds Network Performance Monitor 10.2.2 can be attacked by modifying the snmpd.conf file with malicious JavaScript (XSS) (CWE-79) (CVE-2012-2577). The malicious JavaScript is stored in the application and then may be leveraged to mount an CSRF (CWE-352) (CVE-2012-2602) attack against a logged on administrator.",
  "ID": "VU#174119",
  "IDNumber": "174119",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.",
  "Keywords": [

    "xss"
  ],
  "Overview": "Solarwinds Network Performance Monitor 10.2.2 and possibly earlier versions contain a cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
  "References": "http://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/Orion/docs/ReleaseNotes/releaseNotes.htm",
  "Resolution": "Apply an Update Solarwinds has released Network Performance Monitor 10.3.1 to address these vulnerabilities. Customers may obtain the update from the Solarwinds Customer Portal.",
  "Revision": 17,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "Thanks to Offensive Security for reporting these vulnerabilities.",
  "Title": "Solarwinds Network Performance Monitor 10.2.2 contains multiple vulnerabilities",

  "VRDA_D1_DirectReport": "1",
  "VRDA_D1_Impact": "3",
  "VRDA_D1_Population": "1",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
