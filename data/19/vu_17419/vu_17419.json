  "Description": "(From SNI) A vulnerability in the tgetent(3) library routine can result in a\nbuffer overflow in the telnet daemon on BSD derived systems.  By\nuploading an alternate terminal capability database, an attacker\ncan exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized super-user\naccess to a vulnerable system.\n\nThis problem can be exploited by mailing a file into the system, or\nuploading a file via FTP.  Once this file has been transferred to\nthe remote system, the attacker must only be able to connect to the\ntelnet daemon, to obtain super-user access.",
