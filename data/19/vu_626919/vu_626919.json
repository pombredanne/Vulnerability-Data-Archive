  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker or intruder who has write access to the local file system and who can discover the PIDs of other processes (both  capabilities are typical for ordinary local users) can overwrite any file\non the system regardless of the permissions on the  file. This ability can be leveraged to gain root access in many circumstances.",

  "Overview": "A race condition in the 'periodic' script allows local files to be overwritten. We believe that 'periodic' is typically used only with FreeBSD systems, though it may be installed on other systems.",
