  "Impact": "This bug may introduce vulnerabilities into any program that includes the affected library. Depending upon how and where the zlib routines are called from the given program, the resulting vulnerability may have one or more of the following impacts: denial of service, information leakage, or execution of arbitrary code.",

  "Overview": "There is a bug in the zlib compression library that may manifest itself as a vulnerability in programs that are linked with zlib. This may allow an attacker to conduct a denial-of-service attack, gather information, or execute arbitrary code. It is important to note that the CERT/CC has not received any reports of exploitation of this bug. Based on the information available to us at this time, it is difficult to determine whether this bug can be successfully exploited. However, given the widespread deployment of zlib, we have published this document as a proactive measure.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade your version of zlib The maintainers of zlib have released version 1.1.4 to address this vulnerability. Any software that is linked to or derived from an earlier version of zlib should be upgraded immediately. The latest version of zlib is available at http://www.zlib.org. These are the MD5 checksums for zlib version 1.1.4: abc405d0bdd3ee22782d7aa20e440f08 zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz\n9bf1d36ced334b0cf1f996f5c8171018 zlib114.zip The maintainers of zlib have published an advisory regarding this issue; for further information, please see http://www.gzip.org/zlib/advisory-2002-03-11.txt Apply a patch from your vendor The zlib compression library is freely available and used by many vendors in a wide variety of applications. Any one of these applications may contain vulnerabilities that are introduced by this vulnerability. For the most recent information available to the CERT/CC, please see the vendor section of this document.",
