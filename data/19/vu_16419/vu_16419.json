  "Description": "A private device cache file feature was introduced at lsof\nrevision 3.18 to speed up subsequent calls to lsof by reducing\nthe need for a full scan of the nodes in /dev (or /devices).\nAccompanying the feature was an option (-D) that allowed the\nlsof user to specify where the device cache file was to be\nrecorded.\n\nSince lsof normally runs with effective group ID permission\nset to the group that can read kernel memory devices, the -D\noption might allow lsof to write its device cache file to a\nlocation not normally accessible to the real user or group\nowning the lsof process.  The locations where the lsof device\ncache file might be inappropriately recorded depend on the\ngroup that owns the memory devices and to what other files\nand directories the group has write permission.",
  "ID": "VU#16419",
  "IDNumber": "16419",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Unauthorized users may be able to write the lsof device cache\nfile to normally-restricted locations, possibly in place of\nimportant system files. The vulnerability can be exploited only by users with a valid\naccount. It cannot be exploited by arbitrary remote users. The vulnerability affects all lsof revisions 3.18 through 3.43\non UNIX dialects where device cache file support has been\nimplemented.",
