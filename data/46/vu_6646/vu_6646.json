  "Description": "We have migrated our Anonymous FTP service from a\nUltrix 4.3 machine to a OSF/1 2.1B machine.  On the Ultrix 4.3 machine\nAnonymous FTP users were not able to upload into the FTP server area\nunless a user on the FTP server machine placed a file with appropriate\npermissions for the Anonymous FTP user to deposit the data.  Thus if\nany commercial software or destructive (virus or trojan horse) software\nwere place in the Anonymous FTP area, we could trace it back to a validated\nuser on our machine.  The Anonymous FTP area is NFS mounted from a VMS 5.5-2\nmachine running TGV's MultiNet software.\n\nDEC standing is that the NFS Server should do the permission checking since\nthis is how it is done on other NFS Server implementations even though the\nUltrix NFS client did the checking thus why it worked in that environment.\n\nTGV's standing is that VMS allows owners of directories to create files no\nmatter what the permissions are.  Thus, they feel that if any checking\nshould be done it should be done in the NFS Client.",
