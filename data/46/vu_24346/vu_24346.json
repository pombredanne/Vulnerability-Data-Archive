  "Workarounds": "Disable the HTTP management interface If it is not possible or practical to immediately patch an affected device, temporarily disabling its HTTP management interface will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Restrict access to the HTTP management interface If it is not possible to disable the HTTP management interface, users should restrict outside networks from accessing it. For information on how to implement these restrictions, please consult the Cisco advisory at: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ioshttpserver-pub.shtml"
