  "Description": ">...on my BSDI2.0 machine running Netscape 1.1N, this causes a segmentation\n>fault and subsequent coredump. GDB reports nothing useable (stripped\n>executable)\n\n\nThis is indeed a stack overwrite.  However due to the window\nrestore/save mechanism of the sparc, we're not able to overwrite the\nreturn address for this function.  However, it may be possible to\noverwrite a return address from a previously flushed frame (this is\narchitecture specific).\n\nThe core dump obtained from this url, is due to passing two local pointers\nwhich have been overwritten.  In order to progress further, these would\nneed to point to valid addresses.  Normally, these point to global or static\nbuffers containing http:... strings.",
