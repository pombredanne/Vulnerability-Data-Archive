  "ID": "VU#846846",
  "IDNumber": "846846",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If a remote, unauthenticated attacker supplies a vulnerable DNS implementation with a specially crafted query, they may be able to cause that DNS software to enter an infinite loop eventually consuming 100% CPU resources. This will cause the software to crash  resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
