  "Description": "SVR4 does not preload files into\nmemory when mmap()ed.  If the pages are not present in memory at the\ntime the access attempt is made, the read() system call does return\nthe correct EFAULT error and does not modify the file.\nThe other scenario is if the file IS in core at the time.  The read()\ndoes not seem to check permissions on the ram.  The file is copied.\nThere is an optional third argument to cause this program to scan the\nmmap()ed area, ensureing that the pages are \"in-core\". So, to\noverwrite a file, the user NEEDS read permission only!",
