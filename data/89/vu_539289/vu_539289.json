  "Description": "Microsoft.XMLDOM is an ActiveX control that can run in Internet Explorer without requiring any prompting to the user. This object contains methods that can leak information about a computer system to the operator of a website. By looking at error codes provided by the XMLDOM ActiveX control, an attacker can check for the presence of local drive letters, directory names, files, as well as internal network addresses or websites. We have confirmed that this issue affects Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 running on Microsoft Windows through version 8.1. This vulnerability is actively being used by exploit code in the wild.",
