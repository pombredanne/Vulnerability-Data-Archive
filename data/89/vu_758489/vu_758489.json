  "Description": "Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. If Exim is built without specifying the ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY configuration option, then the Exim user can invoke Exim with an arbitrary configuration file. The Exim developers note that this option is unspecified by default. Consequently, any ${run...} directives specified in that configuration file will be executed as root. Note: this vulnerability has been reported being exploited in the wild.",
  "ID": "VU#758489",
  "IDNumber": "758489",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A local attacker with the ability to execute commands as the Exim user may be able to execute code with root privileges.",
  "Keywords": "ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY",
  "Overview": "A vulnerability in the way that the Exim mail server handles configuration files may allow a local attacker to gain escalated privileges on an affected system.",

  "Workarounds": "Ensure that Exim is built with the ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY option enabled The Exim developers note that this may result in a loss of functionality in certain cases where more than one configuration is in use. Specifically, the exim user will no longer be permitted to invoke Exim with an alternative configuration file and have it executed with root privileges."
