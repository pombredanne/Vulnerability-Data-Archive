  "Description": "The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. The database configuration supplied with some versions of the K2000 appliance includes an administrative account with a known username and discernible password. A remote attacker with the ability to connect to the database component may be able to inject commands into a specific database table that will then be executed with administrative privileges by the Task Processor component of the appliance. Note that systems are only vulnerable if remote access to the database has been enabled. By default, remote access to the included database server is not enabled, however, an attacker may be able to leverage a separate vulnerability (e.g., VU#135606) to enable this access.",
