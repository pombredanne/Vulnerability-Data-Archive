  "Description": "Sun incorrectly released demo CDs having flawed installation scripts\n\nLast friday 2/16/96 I was asked how the Netscape client determines\nwhat application to use for a given datatype.  I pulled up my\n.mailcap file (though I thought it would be empty) in order to\ngive an example of how the MIME mapping works with Netscape.  Much\nto my chagrin it was not empty but contained a single line:\n\napplication/x-spam-sh; /bin/sh %s\n\nHaving an 'evil' server be able to exec shell commands under my UID\nseems like a very bad idea!  I do not know how someone was able to\nadd a line to my .mailcap file.  The permissions are:\n\n-rw-r--r--   1 neruda   staff         35 Feb  9 09:58 BU/.mailcap",
