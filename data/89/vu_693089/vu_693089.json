  "Description": "ALM does not check the length of a field used in various commands sent to the server via TCP port 4410. This vulnerability may lead to remote code execution. In multiple cases, ALM does not check the length of fields used in various commands sent to the server via TCP Port 4410. These vulnerabilities cause exceptions within the application, which cause the application to quit and enable denial-of-service attacks. ALM does not check the content of a field used for command sent to the server via TCP port 4410. This vulnerability causes a null pointer dereference, which cause the application to quit and enables a Denial-of-Service attack. ALM uses an ActiveX control in its graphical user interface. This control exports a method that allows saving a file to the local hard disk. A malicious web site that the user accesses with Internet Explorer may delete the content of any file on the system that the user is allowed to write to, and create new files.
