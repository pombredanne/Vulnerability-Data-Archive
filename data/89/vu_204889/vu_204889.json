  "Workarounds": "Disable the Flash ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The Flash ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}]\n\"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nRemove Flash Adobe has provided instructions for removing the Flash 6 ActiveX control. Alternatively, a utility has been provided to automatically remove the Flash ActiveX control and plug-in. Apply an update This issue can be mitigated by installing the latest version of Adobe Flash. Flash 6 is no longer supported, and installing Adobe Flash 10 will replace the existing Flash ActiveX control(s). Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0"
