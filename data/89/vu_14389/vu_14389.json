  "Description": "The core component of the problem is that by using the PORT command\nin active FTP mode, an attacker may be able to establish\nconnections to arbitrary ports on machines other than the\noriginating client. This behavior is RFC compliant, but it is also\npotentially a source of security problems for some sites. The\nexample attacks described in the tech tip demonstrate the potential\nof this vulnerability.\n\nNote that the problem here is that the PORT command can be used to\nconnect to a third party machine other than the originating\nclient.\n\nA similar exploitation of this same problem is when the attacker\nattacks an arbitrary port (regardless of whether the port is on a\nthird-party machine or on a local machine).  Here the attacker may\neven be attacking just the rlogin port (for example) on the local\nmachine.\n\nIn both cases however, the same root cause exists - the PORT\ncommand is broken.",
