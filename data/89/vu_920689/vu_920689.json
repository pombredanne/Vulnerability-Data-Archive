  "ID": "VU#920689",
  "IDNumber": "920689",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause the kernel to panic (Oops) on a vulnerable system, thereby creating a denial of service.. If the vulnerable software is running on a server, all clients that rely on the server will also be affected.",
