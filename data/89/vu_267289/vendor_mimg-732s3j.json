  "Revision": 2,
  "Status": "Vulnerable",
  "Vendor": "Sun Microsystems, Inc.",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "MIMG-732S3J",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "Sun can confirm that while Solaris has support for the IPv6 Routing Header type 0 that is described in VU#267289, packets containing this header extension are discarded by default on Solaris 9 and 10, and Solaris 8 can be configured to discard them by setting a kernel driver parameter. For Solaris systems, this setting is controlled by the ip6_forward_src_routed kernel driver parameter, which defaults to 1 on Solaris 8 systems, and 0 on later systems. The 'ndd(1M)' command can be used to set this variable, for example to set it for the current session the command could be used as follows: # ndd -set /dev/ip ip6_forward_src_routed 0 More details are available from the following blog post: http://blogs.sun.com/security/entry/ipv6_routing_header_issues"
