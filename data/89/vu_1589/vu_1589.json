  "Description": "The script /usr/lib/newsyslog is run from root's crontab once a week\nto roll over the syslog file in /var/log.  This script will move the\ncurrent syslog file to syslog.0, copy /dev/null to syslog, then do a\nchmod 666 on syslog.  Also, when the script copies /dev/null to syslog\nit leaves it as group \"other\" which appears to be the default for new\nroot owned files.  This is another possible security problem if a site\nwhere to assign users to the \"other\" group.\n\nAdditionally, the file /var/log/sysidconfig.log is mode 777 and owned by\nroot.  This presents additional potential problems since it is\nexecutable.\n\nI can see no reason why the syslog files or sysidconfig.log should be\nworld writable, why invite someone to hide break-in tracks?  Also, in\ngeneral, mode 666 files are a security concern.",

  "Workarounds": "I have changed the newsyslog script on my systems as follows: Instead of chmod 666 I do a chmod 660\nAfter the chmod I have added a chgrp sys command Here is the output of diff of the original file compared to the changes\nI made. 30c30,31\n<               chmod 666    $LOG >               chmod 660    $LOG\n>               chgrp sys    $LOG I have also changed the permissions on sysidconfig.log to be 660 since\nit is a log file and does not need to be executed. Additionally, depending on the security policy of individual sites it\nmay be a good idea to remove the world read permission from\n/var/log/authlog to prevent people from reading it. I have not seen a patch from Sun that addresses any of these issues. If\nthese are known problems that have been solved already please ignore this\n\"heads up\" and point me in the direction of the patch."
