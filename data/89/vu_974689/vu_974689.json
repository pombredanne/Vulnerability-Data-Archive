  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This attacker-supplied code would be run with the privileges of the user running the Helix Server.",
  "Keywords": [
    "RealNetworks",
    "Helix Universal Server",
    "buffer overflow",

  "Overview": "The RealNetworks' Helix Universal Server supports delivery of several different media types over the Internet. Vulnerabilities have been discovered in the way it handles some requests from the network. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable access to the Helix Server via HTTP If patches cannot be applied, limit access to the HTTP service (80/tcp) on the vulnerable systems to trusted systems on the network. Note that this will not prevent internal attackers from exploiting this vulnerability, but can limit exposure. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends blocking access to all services that are not explicitly required."
