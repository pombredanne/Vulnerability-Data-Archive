  "VendorStatement": "X.Org Security Advisory, March 20th 2006\nLocal privilege escalation in X.Org server 1.0.0 and later; X11R6.9.0\nand X11R7.0\nCVE-ID: CVE-2006-0745 Overview: During the analysis of results from the Coverity code review of X.Org,\nwe discovered a flaw in the server that allows local users to execute\narbitrary code with root privileges, or cause a denial of service by\noverwriting files on the system, again with root privileges. Vulnerability details: When parsing arguments, the server takes care to check that only root\ncan pass the options -modulepath, which determines the location to load\nmany modules providing server functionality from, and -logfile, which\ndetermines the location of the logfile. Normally, these locations\ncannot be changed by unprivileged users. This test was changed to test the effective UID as well as the real UID\nin X.Org. The test is defective in that it tested the address of the\ngeteuid function, not the result of the function itself. As a result,\ngiven that the address of geteuid() is always non-zero, an unpriviliged\nuser can load modules from any location on the filesystem with root\nprivileges, or overwrite critical system files with the server log. Affected versions: xorg-server 1.0.0, as shipped with X11R7.0, and all release candidates\nof X11R7.0, is vulnerable. X11R6.9.0, and all release candidates, are vulnerable. X11R6.8.2 and earlier versions are not vulnerable. To check which version you have, run Xorg -version: % Xorg -version\nX Window System Version 7.0.0\nRelease Date: 21 December 2005\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 7.0 Fix: Apply the patch below to xorg-server-1.0.0 and 1.0.1 from the modular\nX11R7 tree: 80db6a3ab76334061ec6102e74ef5607          xorg-server-1.0.1-geteuid.diff\n44b44fa3efc63697eefadc7c2a1bfa50a35eec91  xorg-server-1.0.1-geteuid.diff\nhttp://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R7.0/patches/ Alternately, xorg-server 1.0.2 has been released with this and other\ncode fixes: 5cd3316f07ed32a05cbd69e73a71bc74          xorg-server-1.0.2.tar.bz2\nb2257e984c5111093ca80f1f63a7a9befa20b6c0  xorg-server-1.0.2.tar.bz2\nf44f0f07136791ed7a4028bd0dd5eae3          xorg-server-1.0.2.tar.gz\n3f5c98c31fe3ee51d63bb1ee9467b8c3fcaff5f3  xorg-server-1.0.2.tar.gz\nhttp://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/xserver/ Apply the patch below to the X.Org server as distributed with X11R6.9: de85e59b8906f76a52ec9162ec6c0b63          x11r6.9.0-geteuid.diff\nf9b73b7c1bd7d6d6db6d23741d5d1125eea5f860  x11r6.9.0-geteuid.diff\nhttp://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R6.9.0/patches/ Thanks: We would like to thank Coverity for the use of their Prevent code audit\ntool, which discovered this particular flaw."
