  "Workarounds": "Restrict access You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by VERITAS Backup Exec Remote Agent (typically 10000/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. Change the default port for the backup service Changing the backup service's default port from 10000/tcp may reduce the chances of exploitation. Instructions on how to change the default port for the backup service are available in VERITAS support document 255174. Encrypt sensitive information To prevent attackers from reading sensitive information, consider encrypting it on your file system."
