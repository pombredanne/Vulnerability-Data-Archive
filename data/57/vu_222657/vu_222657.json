  "Description": "RealFlex RealWin is a SCADA server package for medium and small applications designed to control and monitor real-time applications. The RealWin application runs an HMI service on port 912/tcp. This service is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflows. One vulnerability is caused by the use of sprintf() in the SCPC_INITIALIZE() and SCPC_INITIALIZE_RF() functions. The second vulnerability is caused by the use of strcpy() in the SCPC_TXTEVENT() function. Further information is available in ICS_CERT Advisory ICSA-10-313-01",

  "IDNumber": "222657",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the service account on to the target machine. If the service account has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system.",
