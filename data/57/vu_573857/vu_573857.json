  "Resolution": "Upgrade The Mozilla project has released version 1.0.7 of the Firefox web browser which includes a patch for this issue. Firefox users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software. The Mozilla project has also released version 1.7.12 of the Mozilla Suite product which includes a patch for this issue. Mozilla Suite users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable the use of IDN Mozilla and Firefox users are encouraged to consider disabling IDN. While implementing this workaround does not correct the buffer overflow error, it prevents the vulnerable portion of code from being exploited. This can be accomplished by adding the following line to the prefs.js file: user_pref(\"network.enableIDN\", false); or by following these steps: Open the browser, type about:config into the location bar, and hit enter. In the \"Filter\" dialog box, enter \"network.enableIDN\" (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. A single Preference Name should appear in the results. Double-click on the result. In Firefox, this will toggle the value from true to false. In Mozilla, this will open a dialog box titled \"Enter boolean value.\"  Enter \"false\" into this box and hit enter."
