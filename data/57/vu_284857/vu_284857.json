  "Impact": "Remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ISC DHCPD.",
  "Keywords": [

    "DHCPD",
    "minires library",
    "buffer overflow",
    "DHCP"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Internet Software Consortium (ISC) has discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in their implementation of DHCP (ISC DHCPD). These vulnerabilities may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. At this time, we are not aware of any exploits.",
  "References": [
    "http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/",
    "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt"
  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply a patch The ISC has addressed these vulnerabilities in versions 3.0pl2 and 3.0.1RC11 of ISC DHCPD. If your software vendor supplies ISC DHCPD as part of an operating system distribution, please see the vendor section of this document.",

  "ThanksAndCredit": "The CERT Coordination Center thanks David Hankins of the Internet Software Consortium for notifying us about this problem and for helping us to construct this document. We also thank Jacques A. Vidrine for drawing attention to this issue.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Disable dynamic DNS updates (NSUPDATE) As an interim measure, the ISC recommends disabling the NSUPDATE feature on affected DHCP servers. Block external access to DHCP server ports As an interim measure, it is possible to limit exposure to these vulnerabilities by restricting external access to affected DHCP servers on the following ports: bootps      67/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Server\nbootps      67/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Server\nbootpc      68/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Client\nbootpc      68/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Client Disable the DHCP service As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any service or capability that is not explicitly required. Depending on your network configuration, you may not need to use DHCP."
