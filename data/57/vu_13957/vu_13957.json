  "Description": "There is a race condition with respect to the shell variable noclobber in some implementations of csh/tcsh. noclobber is supposed to prevent files from being overwritten if they exist. \n\nIf the file doesn't exist, some implementations of csh determine that fact with a stat() call. If stat returns ENOENT then the shell proceeds to write on the file. However, the file could be created between the stat and write calls, thus defeating the purpose of the noclobber variable. \n\n",
