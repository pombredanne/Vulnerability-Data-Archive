  "Overview": "The RealNetworks' Helix Universal Server supports delivery of several different media types over the Internet via RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol). Vulnerabilities have been discovered in the way it handles some RTSP requests. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable access to the Helix Server via RTSP If patches cannot be applied, limit access to the RTSP service (554/tcp) on the vulnerable systems to trusted systems on the network. Note that this will not prevent internal attackers from exploiting this vulnerability, but can limit exposure. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends blocking access to all services that are not explicitly required."
