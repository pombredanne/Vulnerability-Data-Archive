  "Description": "When vi is killed, it runs expreserve to save\nthe current file being edited.  Expreserve is setuid root and\nsaves the file to a directory owned by the calling user.\nSo it tries to remove any pre-existing file (a symbolic link)\nbefore saving so that it isn't tricked into overwriting an\nexisting file, but the check is flawed and does not work.\nEven if it did work, there would be a very small timing window\nwhere the file could be re-created just after being removed\nby expreserve.\n\nAbove is as it works on Suns.  HP says they have a \"similar\"\nproblem but no details yet.",
