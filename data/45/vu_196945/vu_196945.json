  "ID": "VU#196945",
  "IDNumber": "196945",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute privileged commands or code with the same permissions as the BIND server. Because BIND is typically run by a superuser account, the execution would occur with superuser privileges.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Overview": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC). There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in BIND 8.2.x, which may allow remote intruders to gain access to systems running BIND. DNS servers running BIND 8 are responsible for the majority of name resolution services on the Internet. This vulnerability has been successfully exploited in a laboratory environment and presents a serious threat to the Internet infrastructure.",

  "Resolution": "The ISC has released BIND version 8.2.3 to address this security issue as well as others. The CERT/CC strongly recommends that all users of BIND 8.2.x upgrade to 8.2.3 immediately. The ISC recommends that users affected by this vulnerability upgrade to either BIND 8.2.3 or BIND 9.1. The BIND 8.2.3 distribution can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/ The BIND 9.1 distribution can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/ Please note that upgrading to BIND 8.2.3 also addresses the information leakage vulnerability discussed in VU#325431.",
