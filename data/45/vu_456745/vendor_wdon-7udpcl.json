This also includes techniques that can be used to bypass the kill bit in Internet Explorer. Update and recompile ActiveX controls Developers who have created ActiveX controls using Microsoft ATL should install the update for Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035 and recompile the ActiveX controls. This will cause the controls to use an updated ATL version that addresses these vulnerabilities.",
