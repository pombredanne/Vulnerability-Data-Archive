  "Description": "Wyse Device Manager (WDM, formerly known as Wyse Rapport) manages thin clients. Part of the server component (HServer) is implemented as an ISAPI filter on the Microsoft Windows Internet Information Server (IIS) platform. The client component (HAgent) runs as a service on Microsoft Windows systems. WDM components contain several vulnerabilities: HServer (hserver.dll) User-Agent header stack buffer overflow and\nHAgent (hagent.exe) heap overflow (both overflows are CVE-2009-0693)\nHAgent does not authenticate commands (CVE-2009-0695)\nThe first two issues are implementation defects. The third issue is caused by the lack of adequate cryptographic authentication and authorization.",
  "ID": "VU#654545",
  "IDNumber": "654545",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "An attacker with network access to WDM components could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker could also execute unauthenticated management commands on a system running HAgent.",

  "Workarounds": "Enable HTTPS Enabling HTTPS provides authentication between Hserver and HAgent nodes. HTTPS authenticates communication from an HServer host to an HAgent host. Depending on key distribution and PKI architecture, HTTPS should prevent an unauthenticated attacker from running management commands on an HAgent host."
