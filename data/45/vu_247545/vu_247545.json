  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Using firewall or similar technology, restrict direct access to SQL servers to only those hosts and networks that require it. By default, SQL Server 2000 listens on port 1433/tcp. Named/clustered SQL instances may require special configuration. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article\u00a0287932 for more information. Note that this will only limit the possible sources of attacks."
