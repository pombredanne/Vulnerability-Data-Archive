  "Workarounds": "Filter network traffic Network firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and packet filtering technology may be able to detect and block LAND attacks. If a perimeter network device is configured to drop incoming packets with source IP addresses that match addresses within the network, a remote attacker may not be able to exploit this vulnerability."
