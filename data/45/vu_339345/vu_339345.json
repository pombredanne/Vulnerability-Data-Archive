  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Limit network access to hosts that require connections to the portal. Do not allow access to the portal from untrusted networks such as the internet. Filter URLs Using a reverse HTTP proxy, web server URL filtering, or similar technology, it may be possible to restrict the names and extensions of files that can be uploaded to the Proficy Information Portal. Modify Web Server Permissions It may be possible to modify web server permissions to prevent file uploads. This may impact portal functionality."
