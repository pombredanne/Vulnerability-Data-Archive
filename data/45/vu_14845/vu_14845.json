  "Description": "lpr(1) can be used to overwrite or create (and become owner of)\nany file on the system.  lpr -s allows users to create symbolic\nlinks in lpd's spool directory (typically /var/spool/lpd).\nAfter 1000 invocations of lpr, lpr will reuse the filename in\nthe spool directory, and follow the link previously installed.\nIt will thus overwrite/create any file that this link points too.",
