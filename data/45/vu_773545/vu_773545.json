  "Overview": "The NOS Microsystems Adobe getPlus Helper ActiveX control contains stack buffer overflows, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
  "References": "http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-02.html",
  "Resolution": "Please see Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-02. Although this vulnerability is addressed in 1.6.2.49 of the getPlus Helper control, the control is removed when the system is restarted. Therefore, it may be possible for an attacker to convince the user to install the vulnerable version of the control, even on a system that has installed the fixed control at some point. Please consider the following workarounds:",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the getPlus Helper ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The getPlus Helper ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {E2883E8F-472F-4fb0-9522-AC9BF37916A7} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{E2883E8F-472F-4fb0-9522-AC9BF37916A7}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{E2883E8F-472F-4fb0-9522-AC9BF37916A7}]\n\"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0"
