  "IDNumber": "492545",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to craft a malicious Zip archive that will evade detection by anti-virus software using Archive::Zip. Once in the system, if the remote attacker can persuade the user to accesses the malicious archive, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with administrator privileges.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Archive::Zip",
    "anti-virus software",
    "Zip archive"
  ],
  "Overview": "Archive::Zip does not properly parse Zip files and may incorrectly interpret malformed zip archives to contain zero length/size files. As a a result, anti-virus software using Archive::Zip may fail to detect malicious content within a Zip archive.",
