  "VendorStatement": "\"MatrixSSL version support is configured with compile-time define, and we have disabled SSL3.0 by default since MatrixSSL 3.3.1 on July 16, 2012. Anyone using MatrixSSL over the past 2 years would have had to manually enable SSL 3.0. Also, we do TLS style padding for SSL3.0 since the beginning for record encoding, however we can\u00b9t enforce it on decoding, so that was of limited use unless communicating with our own library\""
