  "Description": "SUN's DECnet emulation program (DNI) gives incorrect\nfile permissions to files transferred to a DECNET host.\nDNICP will copy a file from a SUN unix platform to the VAX via\nDECnet.  It will set the RWE bits for the OWNER, GROUP and WORLD\nUIC based protections to correspond to a protection that is equivalent\nto the one defined on the SUN.  But, in all cases, it will grant\ndelete access to all categories.  In addition, default directory and\nACE specified protections will be overridden.",
  "ID": "VU#13593",
  "IDNumber": "13593",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A file transferred using DNI can be deleted by any user on the VMS\nhost. If they have a minimal access of execute to the parent\ndirectory, all they would need to know is a path and a file name.",

  "Workarounds": "The interim fix is simple - after the file has been copied to\nthe VAX, log into the VAX and reset the protections. You can use the\nfollowing: VMS prompt> SD target_directory\nVMS prompt> SET PROT=(G,W) transfered_file.name\nor\nVMS prompt> SD target_directory\nVMS prompt> PROT_DIR"
