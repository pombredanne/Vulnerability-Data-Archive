  "Impact": "Attackers may abuse HTTP TRACE functionality to gain access to information in HTTP headers such as cookies and authentication data. In the presence of other cross-domain vulnerabilities in web browsers, sensitive header information could be read from any domains that support the HTTP TRACE method.",

  "Overview": "The HTTP TRACE method returns the contents of client HTTP requests in the entity-body of the TRACE response. Attackers could leverage this behavior to access sensitive information, such as cookies or authentication data, contained in the HTTP headers of the request.",

  "Resolution": "Disable HTTP TRACE support Based on site requirements and policy, consider disabling HTTP TRACE support in web servers. As a best practice, we recommend limiting input (\"whitelisting\") to the minimum set of methods required for proper operation of a given application. Apache HTTP Server To disable HTTP TRACE support, set TraceEnable Off. Alternatively, use the Apache mod_rewrite module to deny HTTP TRACE requests or to permit only the methods needed to meet site requirements and policy. TRACE requests can be disabled with the following mod_rewrite syntax: RewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE\nRewriteRule .* - [F] Disabling HTTP TRACE with the TraceEnable directive is simpler, more direct, and requires less overhead than using mod_rewrite. Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Use the URLScan tool to deny HTTP TRACE requests or to permit only the methods needed to meet site requirements and policy. The default configurations of Urlscan 2.5 (both baseline and SRP) only permit GET and HEAD methods.",
