  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds may mitigate this vulnerability: Using IPSec or other virtual private network network technologies to provide secure communications and authentication for machines running the EnCase Servlet may mitigate this vulnerability by preventing attackers from injecting or manipulating data. IDS systems capable of detecting ARP spoofing may be able to alert administrators when this attack vector is being exploited."
