  "Workarounds": "Disallow uploads PhpWiki can be configured to disallow uploads by moving or removing lib/plugin/UpLoad.php. Restrict uploads of PHP files This vulnerability can be mitigated by restricting the ability to upload PHP files. This can be accomplished by adding the following lines to the list of disallowed extensions: .php\n.phtml\n.php3\n.php4\n.php5\nNote that this list may not be exhaustive. Other web server and PHP configurations may allow other file extensions to be processed by PHP."
