  "Description": "There exists a problem with the xterm logging function that allows\naccess to root files which can quickly lead to root shell access.\nThis has been fixed by X.org and most vendors.  The problem and\nalternative solutions have also been discussed in newsgroups.",
  "ID": "VU#19293",
  "IDNumber": "19293",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Xterm is a setuid root program, but the user is allowed to\nspecify what file should be used for logging. The access permission\nchecks on that log file are flawed and it is possible for a\nnon-privileged user to create a new file anywhere in the system, owned\nby root, and whose contents are under the control of that user.",

  "Workarounds": "For this particular vulnerability, using symbolic links, one solution\nwould be to add the necessary code to stat(2) the filename and see if\nit is a symbolic link and if so, track down the \"real\" parent directory. But this is cumbersome to do properly, and runs the risk of missing\nother checks made by the kernel, such as access control lists, which might\ncurrently exist or be added later. A cleaner solution for implementations that support the \"saved set-user\"\nconcept, would be to setuid/setgid back to the real uid/gid,\ndo the open(2) *allowing the _kernel_ to make whatever checks it wishes*,\nthen setuid/setgid back to the saved ids. A workaround that was reported to us is to remove the setuid bit\nfrom xterm so that it runs as the user. Xterm does have code\nto maintain the wtmp, utmp, and lastlog files, so if those files\nare not publicly writable (and there are good reasons for them\nnot to be), then xterm will not be able to update them."
