  "Description": "AVG Secure Search is a toolbar add-on for web browsers that \"... provides an additional security layer while searching and surfing to protect you from infected websites.\" One of the components provided by AVG Secure Search is an ActiveX control called ScriptHelperApi, which is provided by ScriptHelper.exe. This ActiveX control is marked as Safe for Scripting in Internet Explorer, which means that the author has determined that the control cannot be repurposed by an attacker. Because this control does not internally enforce any restrictions on which sites may invoke its methods, such as by using the SiteLock template, this means that any website can invoke the methods exposed by the ScriptHelper ActiveX control. The installer for AVG Secure Search also sets the ElevationPolicy registry value for the control, which means that the control is excluded from the Internet Explorer Protected Mode sandbox. The installer for AVG Secure Search also sets the Preapproved registry value, which bypasses the Internet Explorer ActiveX Opt-In feature that was introduced with IE 7. The AVG Safeguard and Secure Search ScriptHelper ActiveX control versions up to and including version 18.1.6 contain a number of unsafe methods that can be used in Internet Explorer. Other browsers do not appear to be affected.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update This issue is addressed in AVG Secure Search toolbar version 18.1.7.598 and AVG Safeguard 18.1.7.644. While these versions are still marked as Safe for Scripting, this version of the control has restrictions in place that prevent its use by web pages hosted by domains other than .avg.com or .avg.nation.com.
