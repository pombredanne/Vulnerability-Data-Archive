  "Impact": "An attacker who can intercept network traffic or send an invalid loin request can obtain authentication credentials and decrypt passwords.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Prolog Manager",
    "information disclosure",
    "predictable encryption",

    "INFO#11101"
  ],
  "Overview": "Meridian Systems Prolog Manager does not use sufficiently strong encryption and returns a list of all user credentials when authenticating clients. These behaviors could allow an attacker to obtain user credentials and decrypt passwords.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Use database and network encryption \nEnabling the enhanced encryption option may increase the effort required for an attacker to decrpt passwords. See the Meridian November 2004 Product Tip for more information about enabling encryption. Using an encrypted VPN or similar technology when accessing the Prolog Manager server may prevent an attacker from sniffing network traffic."
