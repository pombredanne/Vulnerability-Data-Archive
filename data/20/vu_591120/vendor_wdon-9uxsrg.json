  "Revision": 3,
  "Status": "Not Affected",
  "Vendor": "DigiCert",
  "VendorInformation": "DigiCert does not issue domain-only validated certificates. Instead, we believe the extra checks required by both OV and EV provide the extra assurances necessary to confirm issuance authorization. That's why DigiCert only issues OV and EV certificates. The out-of-bands communication required with these two levels of assurance assures that the organization controlling the domain actually authorized the issuance and prevents hijacked email addresses. In all cases, DigiCert validates the identity of a third party, that the identity has control over the domain, and that the issuance was authorized.",
