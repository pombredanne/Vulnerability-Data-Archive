  "Workarounds": "The mount_msdos and\nmount_union programs have had the setuid bits\ndisabled. They are the only setuid programs that\nwe are aware of using the vfsload() function. A search through the libc sources revealed no\nother execlp() calls of a similar nature. The\nuser in question has been locked out of the system,\npending further investigation and actions."
