  "Description": "A potential security hole has been found and fixed in the linuxconf package in Red Hat Linux 5.1.  No exploit is currently known.  If  the security hole is exploited, hosts that you explicitly trust to administer linuxconf could be capable of gaining root access.  In older versions of linuxconf, the local ethernet network is trusted by default (except when configured via BOOTP or DHCP); in linuxconf-1.11r18-3rh, no hosts are trusted by default.",
