  "Impact": "A remote attacker be able to exploit this vulnerability by supplying the inflate() routine with specially crafted compressed data. As a result, applications linked to the zlib library may abruptly and abnormally terminate resulting in a denial-of-service condition. According to public reports, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, but we have not confirmed this.",

  "Overview": "A buffer overflow in the zlib compression library may cause any application linked to zlib to improperly and immediately terminate.",

  "Resolution": "Apply patches from your vendor The zlib compression library is freely available and used by many vendors in a wide variety of applications. As a result, any one of these applications may contain this vulnerabilitiy. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable and what action to take.",
