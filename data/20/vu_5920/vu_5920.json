  "Description": "Do you read \"best-of-security\"?  Anyway I wanted to suggest that I think there\nshould be a CERT version of AUSCERT's advisory about this security hole; see\nftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/advisory/AA-97.12.sgi.login-lockout.vulnerability\n\nthanks\n\np.s. note that to comment out the LOCKOUT= line from /etc/default/login, or\nto delete the line, or to set the variable explicitly to zero, all have the\nsame effect -- I'm not sure the auscert advisory makes this completely clear",

  "Impact": "Users may create arbitrary or corrupt certain files on the system. The buffer overflow problem permits local users to gain root. The LOCKOUT problem permits remote users without valid accounts to\ncreate files in arbitrary locations and corrupt certain files.",

  "Workarounds": "To prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability described in this\nadvisory, AUSCERT recommends that the functionality provided with the\nLOCKOUT parameter be disabled. The LOCKOUT parameter can be disabled by editing /etc/default/login\nand commenting out the line containing the LOCKOUT parameter. The\ncomment character for /etc/default/login is \"#\". Note that after applying this workaround, accounts will not be\nautomatically locked using the LOCKOUT parameter functionality."
