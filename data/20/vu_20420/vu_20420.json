  "Workarounds": "The quick fix is to add a line to /etc/fbtab of the form\n/dev/console 0600 /dev/audio:/dev/audioctl\nThis sets the protection to be 600 when you login (which sticks around\nwhen you logout) and to set the owner to be whoever is logged into\n/dev/console (which reverts to root when you logout). This does not address the need to give a clear indication to the\nuser that the mike is on."
