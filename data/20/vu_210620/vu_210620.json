  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2014-4883 The DNS resolver implemented in all versions of uIP, as well as lwIP versions 1.4.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to cache poisoning due to non-randomized transaction IDs (TXIDs) and source port reuse. For more information on the technical details and impact of this vulnerability, please refer to VU#800113.",
  "ID": "VU#210620",
