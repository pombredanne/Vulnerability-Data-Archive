  "Description": "Some Java implementations do not check the hash values of classfiles at the time they check the signature of the file containing the hashes.  This leads to timing problems that can confuse the user and possibly open other vulnerabilities.",
  "ID": "VU#1820",
  "IDNumber": "1820",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A user may believe that the classfiles in a JAR file have been checked for integrity when in fact they have not been. The user may then trust a maliciously modified classfile.",
