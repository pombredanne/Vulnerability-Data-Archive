  "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In tests, the public exploit code crashes the RPCSS service on Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems patched with MS03-039. The exploit executes code on Windows 2000 systems that do not have the MS03-039 patch.",

  "Workarounds": "Until patches are available, the following workarounds can be used to reduce possible attack vectors. These workarounds are not complete solutions and may affect network and application operation. Research and test before making changes to production systems. Using a network or host-based firewall, block RPC network traffic (ports 135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, 593/tcp and 135/udp, 137/udp, 138/udp, 445/udp). Disable COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC over HTTP as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825819. Disable DCOM as described Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825750."
