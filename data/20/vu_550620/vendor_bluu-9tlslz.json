  "Vendor": "Hewlett-Packard Company",
  "VendorInformation": "Previous generations of HP printing products may use an implementation of mDNS for device discovery on the network which allows detection outside the local network segment. While this implementation is not recommended by RFC 6762 Section 5.5, it is allowed within the specification. HP\u2019s networking infrastructure for its current device fleet uses an Apple Bonjour implementation with Bonjour. For customers concerned with mDNS use on their network, HP recommends filtering mDNS on UDP Port 5353 at the network perimeter.\u00a0 If desired the customer can manually disable mDNS on supported products using the embedded web server (EWS) configuration functionality (such as the Color LaserJet 4700, Figure A), however this may impact device discovery features including AirPrint, Mopria, and Google Cloud Print 2.0.",
