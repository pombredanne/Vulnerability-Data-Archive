  "Workarounds": "Unregister the AIM protocols Disabling the AIM protocol handler can mitigate this vulnerability. To unregister the protocol handler, delete or rename the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AIM\\ Note that when Trillian (trillian.exe) is started, it will attempt to recreate or repair the registry key. On Windows XP SP2 by default, Administrators and Power Users have permissions to modify the registry key. To prevent Trillian from recreating the registry key, run Trillian with a limited user account. Alternatively, change or delete the value for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AIM\\shell\\open\\command and change permissions so that the appropriate user groups can not recreate or repair the key. Block access to aim: URIs Administrators may partially mitigate this vulnerability by blocking access to the aim: URI using proxy server access control lists or the appropriate content filtering rule."
