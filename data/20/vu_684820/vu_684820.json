  "Description": "",
  "ID": "VU#684820",
  "IDNumber": "684820",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers can obtain victim user priviledges on other hosts running an SSH-1 server.",
  "Keywords": [
    "SSH",
    "client authentication",
    "forward",
    "encryption disabled",
    "public host key",
    "replay attack"
  ],
  "Overview": "A design flaw in the SSH-1 protocol allows a malicious server to establish two concurrent sessions with the same session ID, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. The client must accept unknown host keys from the malicious server to enable exploitation of this vulnerability.",
  "References": [
    "http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/cert/",
    "http://www.openssh.com/security.html"
  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade to SSH-2, which is not vulnerable to this attack.",
  "Revision": 33,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "The CERT/CC would like to thank Antti Huima, Tuomas Aura, and Janne Salmi for their analysis and Tatu Ylonen for bringing this vulnerability to our attention.",
  "Title": "SSH-1 allows client authentication to be forwarded by a malicious server to another server",

  "VRDA_D1_Population": "",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "When using SSH-1, be careful when accepting unknown server keys for SSH connections. Clients should not attempt to start an SSH-1 connection with encryption disabled. Servers should refuse SSH-1 connection requests which have encryption disabled."
