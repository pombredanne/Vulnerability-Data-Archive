  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis vulnerability is addressed by the updates included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-029. Until an update can be applied, the following workarounds may reduce the chances of exploitation. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. For instance, disabling the RPC interface of the DNS service may prevent administrators from being able to remotely manage a Microsoft Windows DNS server. Consider this when implementing the following workarounds:",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the RPC interface used by the Microsoft Windows DNS service This workaround will configure the DNS management service to to function only via Local Procedure Call (LPC). This prevents exploitation of the vulnerability, however it also disables remote management via RPC, which is used by the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) DNS snap-in. According to Microsoft SecurityBulletin MS07-029, the RPC remote management can be disabled by taking the following steps: On the start menu click 'Run' and then type 'Regedit' and then press enter. Navigate to the following registry location: \u201cHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNS\\Parameters\u201d. On the 'Edit' menu select 'New' and then click 'DWORD Value'. Where 'New Value #1' is highlighted type 'RpcProtocol' for the name of the value and then press enter. Double click on the newly created value and change the value's data to 4. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNS\\Parameters] \"RpcProtocol\"=dword:00000004\nThis will restrict the DNS management interface to Local Procedure Call (LPC) only. Note that the DNS service needs to be restarted for the above changes to take effect. More information on regedit.exe is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q82821. Additional information regarding how to disable remote administration of the DNS Server service in Windows Server 2003 and in Windows 2000 Server can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 936263. Block or Restrict access to RPC at the network perimeter This workaround will restrict TCP/IP access to all RPC interfaces, including the vulnerable DNS management RPC interface. This workaround will not prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, but will limit the possible sources of attacks. This workaround will allow remote management using the RPC interface (MMC DNS Snap-in) from selected networks. Access to the RPC Endpoint Mapper service (135/tcp), the ports assigned by the RPC Endpoint Mapper (by default 1024/tcp to 5000/tcp), and SMB services (139/tcp, 139/udp, 445/tcp, and 445/udp) should be blocked at your network perimeter. This will limit your exposure to attacks. Note that blocking RPC and SMB at the network perimeter will still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit this vulnerability. All unsolicited traffic on the ports listed above should be blocked."
