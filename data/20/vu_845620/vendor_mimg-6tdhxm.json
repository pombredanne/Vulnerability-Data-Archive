  "Revision": 2,
  "Status": "Unknown",
  "Vendor": "Cryptlib",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "MIMG-6TDHXM",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "Although cryptlib shouldn't be vulnerable to the original Bleichenbacher attack, there is ongoing discussion about further attacks that affect any RSA keys with e=3. Because the security community currently doesn't know how serious the problem is, cryptlib users should disable the use of any RSA keys with e=3 by changing the check 'if( BN_get_word( e ) < 3 )' in initCheckRSAkey() in context/kg_rsa.c to 'if( BN_get_word( e ) < 17 )'. Note that this will disable the use of a small number of existing keys that use e=3 (although cryptlib itself will never generate or use private keys with this\nvalue), but until the exact nature of the problem is fully understood this is the only safe fix."
