  "VendorStatement": "F-Secure antivirus products are not vulnerable. The list of non-vulnerable products includes F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure Internet Security, F-Secure Client Security, F-Secure Server Security, F-Secure Mobile Security, F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway, F-Secure Network Control, and all other products in F-Secure small business and corporate suites, also listed at http://www.f-secure.com/enterprises/products/. F-Secure VPN+ versions up to version 6.12 are vulnerable in installations that use PKI CA issued certificates, which use third-party generated keys. The RSA key generator in F-Secure products has never allowed the generation of RSA keys with a public exponent of 3. This means that keys created with F-Secure tools cannot be used to mount an attack against F-Secure products or other systems. The F-Secure SSH product line is exclusively distributed by Attachmate under the Reflection for Secure IT brand. Please see the vendor statement from Attachmate for more information."
