  "Resolution": "Apply the appropriate update for your system: Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3, Service Pack 4 - Download the update \nMicrosoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1- Download the update \nMicrosoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition - Download the update As a note in the Microsoft Advisory: Note: The Windows XP security updates that released on October 15th as part of Security Bulletin MS03-043 (828035) include the updated file that helps protect from this vulnerability. If you have applied the Windows XP security updates for MS03-043 (828035) you do not have to reapply this update. However, the Windows 2000 security update that is released as part of this security bulletin contains updated files that were not part of the MS03-043 (828035) security bulletin. Customers have to apply this Windows 2000 security update even if they applied the Windows 2000 security updates for MS03-043 (828035).",

  "Workarounds": "Note the following mitigation strategies from Microsoft's Advisory: If users have blocked inbound UDP ports 138, 139, 445 and TCP ports 138, 139, 445 by using a firewall an attacker would be prevented from sending messages to the Workstation service. Most firewalls, including Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP, block these ports by default. Disabling the Workstation service will prevent the possibility of attack. However there are a number of impacts when performing this workaround. Please see the Workaround section for more details. Only Windows 2000 and Window XP are affected. Other operating systems are not vulnerable to this attack."
