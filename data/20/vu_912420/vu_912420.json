  "Description": "The n.runs AG security advisory states: Notes 8.5.3 does not filter <applet> tags inside HTML emails. This can be used to load arbitrary Java applets from remote sources (making it an information disclosure as well as this can be used to trigger an HTTP request once the mail is previewed/opened). Additional details may be found in the full n.runs AG security advisory. It should also be noted that the IBM JRE that comes with the latest patched version of IBM Notes is IBM JRE 6 SR12 while IBM JRE 6 SR13 has been released and includes many security related fixes.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an Update IBM's Security Bulletin states: The fix will be included in Interim Fix 1 for 8.5.3 Fix Pack 4 and 9.0 Interim Fix 1. The fix disables loading of JAVA applets for emails that originated from the Internet. Please consider the following workarounds if you are unable to upgrade. We also recommend all users implement the following workarounds if they do not have a need for JAVA & Javascript within Notes.",
