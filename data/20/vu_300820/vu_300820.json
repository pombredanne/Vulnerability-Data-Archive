  "Description": "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions Two binaries are included in Cisco Prime version 2.2 that run as SUID root with world-executable privileges. The commands are /opt/CSCOlumos/bin/runShellCommand\n/opt/CSCOlumos/bin/runShellAsRoot These commands may be used to run arbitrary commands as root by any local user. According to Cisco, the default installation does not create any regular users, and Cisco does not support or recommend creating regular users or utilizing the command line shell for administration. Cisco has provided more information in a security advisory (customer user account required to view).",
