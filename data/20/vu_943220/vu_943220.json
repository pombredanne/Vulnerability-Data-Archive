  "Description": "The MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2011-003 states: \"The MIT Kerberos 5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to a double-free condition if the Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) capability is enabled, resulting in daemon crash or arbitrary code execution (which is believed to be difficult).\"",
  "ID": "VU#943220",
  "IDNumber": "943220",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can induce a double-free event, causing the KDC daemon to crash (denial of service), or to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "The KDC in releases krb5-1.7 and later are vulnerable to a double-free vulnerability if they are configured to respond to PKINIT requests.",
