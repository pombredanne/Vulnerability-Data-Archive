  "ID": "VU#392920",
  "IDNumber": "392920",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By establishing a TCP connection with a BlackBerry Router, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service, disrupting communication between BES components and BlackBerry Handheld devices.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Deploy BlackBerry Routers and BES servers according to best practices, including restricting access to BlackBerry components using firewalls. Static DNS entries for BlackBerry Infrastructure hosts can help mitigate the risks of an attacker subverting DNS to impersonate the BlackBerry Infrastructure. Please see RIM Technical Knowledge Center article KB-04758 for further information."
