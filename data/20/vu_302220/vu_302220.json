  "Description": "",
  "ID": "VU#302220",
  "IDNumber": "302220",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker that is able to intercept and modify IPsec (and ICMP, for some scenarios) communications between security gateways may be able to recover plaintext of the IPsec communications between them.",
  "Keywords": [
    "IPsec",
    "confidentiality mode",
    "NISCC",
    "ESP",
    "encapsulating security payload"
  ],
  "Overview": "The IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol used in tunneling mode may be vulnerable to multiple attacks when confidentiality mode is used without integrity protection, or in certain cases where integrity protection is provided by higher-level protocols.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Suggested workarounds include - configuring ESP to use both confidentiality and integrity protection. This is the recommended workaround. - using the Authentication Header (AH) protocol to provide integrity protection along with ESP in a manner which is not vulnerable. - restricting ICMP error reporting with network filters or firewalls."
