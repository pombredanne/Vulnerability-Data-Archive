  "VendorStatement": "The lifecycle script feature that the worm relies upon is intrinsic to the\noperation of npm and many other package managers. We have made a decision\nbalancing security against utility and decided not to disable this feature. Any step short of disabling this feature becomes a cat-and-mouse game of\nattempting to predict what a given user script will do, which becomes akin\nto the halting problem. Our real-world mitigation steps are: 1. registry publishing has a kill switch independent of registry installs,\nso a worm's progress can be instantly halted once identified\n2. we can programmatically identify and un-publish, post-hoc, any\ncompromised packages, reverting them to their last good versions Users who are uncomfortable with this decision can disable this feature at\nthe client side with the `ignore-scripts` option, which can be invoked at\ninstall time or permanently set with `npm config set ignore-scripts true`."
