  "ID": "VU#868916",
  "IDNumber": "868916",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute privileged commands or code with the same permissions as the BIND server. Because BIND is typically run by a superuser account, the execution would occur with superuser privileges.",

  "Overview": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC). There is a format string vulnerability in BIND 4.9.4 that may allow remote intruders to gain access to systems running BIND. Although BIND 4.9.x is no longer officially maintained by ISC, various versions are still widely deployed on the Internet. This vulnerability has been successfully exploited in a laboratory environment and presents a serious threat to the Internet infrastructure.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "This vulnerability was patched by the ISC in an earlier version of BIND 4, most likely BIND 4.9.5-P1. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that some third party vendors who redistribute BIND have not included these changes in their BIND packages. Therefore, the CERT/CC recommends that all users of BIND 4 or its derivatives base their distributions on BIND 4.9.8. The BIND 4.9.8 distribution can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/ The BIND 9.1 distribution can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/ Please note that upgrading to BIND 4.9.8 also addresses the vulnerabilities discussed in VU#325431 and VU#572183.",
