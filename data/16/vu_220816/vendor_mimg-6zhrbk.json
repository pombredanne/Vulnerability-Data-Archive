  "Revision": 2,
  "Status": "Vulnerable",
  "Vendor": "Fedora Project",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "MIMG-6ZHRBK",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "The Fedora Project ships the krb5 telnet daemon in all versions of Fedora Core. Updated packages to correct this issue are available for Fedora Core 5 and 6 along with our advisories at the URLs below: Fedora Core 6: https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2007-April/msg00008.html Fedora Core 5: https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2007-April/msg00009.html This update can also be installed with the 'yum' update program. Note that the krb5 telnet daemon is not enabled by default in any version of Fedora Core. In addition, the default firewall rules block remote access to the telnet port. This flaw does not affect the telnet daemon distributed in the telnet-server package."
