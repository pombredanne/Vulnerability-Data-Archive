  "Description": "Outlook97 has a \"feature\" that autostarts Word97 whenever you open any\nemail message that's been formatted as an outlook template beforehand\n\nNot only does it not ask you to confirm whether or not you want to do\nthis, but there does not appear to be any way of disabling this\nfeature. Even if you have it turned off, it will still start Word to\nread the message.",
