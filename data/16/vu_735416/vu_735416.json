  "Description": "CWE-16: Configuration - CVE-2016-5673 UltraVNC repeater acts as a proxy to route remote desktop VNC connections. IP addresses are not restricted in default configurations, and ports cannot be selectively restricted. Consequently, in a default installation, a repeater can be caused to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts using any port. To initiate a connection to a common web service, for instance, an attacker may request a connection to <IP>::<80><padding>, where padding consists of null bytes and the request length is 250 bytes.",

  "Overview": "UltraVNC repeater versions prior to ultravnc_repeater_1300 do not restrict usage by IP address by default and cannot restrict by ports, which may be leveraged to induce connections to arbitrary hosts using any port.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Update repeater configuration New installations of UltraVNC repeater now default to restricting access to all IP addresses and support more granular port restrictions. Existing installations should consider updating to ultravnc_repeater_1300, review the vendor's advisory, and make modifications as appropriate: \"WARNING:\u00a0 In MODE I the repeater works like a proxy.\u00a0 If you don't limit the destination and or ports your repeater can be used to connect to all ip adresses and all ports that can be reached from the repeater. You need to restrict the ip addreses and ports to prevent unwanted access.\"",
