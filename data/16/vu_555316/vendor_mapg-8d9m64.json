  "VendorStatement": "Vulnerable. This issue affects postfix packages in Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 4, 5, and 6. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this\nissue as having moderate security impact, a future update will address\nthis flaw. This issue did not affect the versions of the sendmail package as shipped\nwith Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, or 6, as Sendmail by switching to\nSMTP over TLS replaces the entire received SMTP commands stream, along\nwith its read/write buffers and read/write functions. This issue did not affect the versions of the exim package as shipped\nwith Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, as Exim by switching to SMTP over\nTLS replaces plaintext read/write functions with TLS read/write functions."
