  "Impact": "A local attacker who is able to modify the configuration of the tibhawkhma program may be able to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. TIBCO states the following: If the tibhawkhma program is installed as suid root on a Unix system, the successful exploit will allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges. If the tibhawkhma program is installed as a system service on a Windows system, the successful exploit will allow arbitrary code execution with system service privileges.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds TIBCO recommends that users who are not able to upgrade employ all of the following workarounds: Set the permissions of the tibhawkhma configuration file such that only the system administrator may write to the configuration file. Set the permissions of the tibhawkhma executable such that only the system administrator may launch the program. On Unix systems, Set the permissions of the tibhawkhma executable such that it is not setuid."
