  "Description": "Name server daemon (NSD) is an open source name server developed by NLnet Labs. NSD contains an off-by-one error that can cause a one-byte buffer overflow when certain packets are processed. The vulnerability exits in the packet_read_query_section() function in packet.c in versions 3.x and in the process_query_section() function in query.c in versions 2.x. Note that this issue affects NSD versions 2.0.0 through 3.2.1.",
