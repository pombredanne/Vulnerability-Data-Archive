  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Because the malicious applet would be located in the context of the legitimate site's domain, it could potentially access any cookies that the legitimate site had placed on the victim user's system. Additionally, any information the malicious applet solicited from the user could be relayed back to the attacker's site instead of the intended site.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable Java - if the ability to run Java applets is not required or desired, configure your web browser to not execute them. Information about disabling Java in various web browsers can be found here. Note that disabling Java in your web browser may not mitigate this vulnerability for Java programs that are invoked via another method."
