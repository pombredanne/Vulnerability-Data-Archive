  "Description": "\nFrom the Cisco Advisory: \n\nErrors in certain Cisco IOS software versions for certain routers can cause\nIP datagrams to be output to network interfaces even though access lists\nhave been applied to filter those datagrams. This applies to routers from\nthe Cisco 7xxx family only, and only when those routers have been configured\nfor distributed fast switching (DFS).\n\n[...]\n\nThese vulnerabilities may permit users to send packets to parts of the\ncustomer's network for which they are not authorized. This may permit\nunauthorized access or other attacks on customer computer systems or data.\nCisco does not know of any incidents in which these vulnerabilities have\nactually been exploited by attackers.",
