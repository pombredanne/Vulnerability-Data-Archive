  "Workarounds": "As of 5/6/94 SCO hadn't produced a patch. They\nare having an internal battle because the fix they know how to implement\nintroduces a race condition problem. They are still trying to find\na complete fix. Workaround is to not use /var/spool/mail for users'\nmail files. Rather, use .mailbox files in the users' home directories. Currently to work around this, put the user's mailbox in their home directory. This is done by changing the /usr/mmdf/mmdftailor file and adding the following\nlines: MDLVRDIR \"\"\nMMBXNAME \".mailbox\"\nMMBXPROT 0600 This will allow the mailbox to be put in the ~$HOME directory for each user,\ncalled .mailbox"
