  "Description": "A new type of virus has surfaced which affects multiple architectures and operating systems. This virus propagates via modification of intpreted data or macros. The general concept has been well known amoung virus experts for years but this is the first implementation in \"the wild\" of such a virus. \n\nMicrosoft Word contains a very powerful macro language and WordBasic. Viruses can leverage the power of these languages to execute arbitrary commands and \"infect\" other files by adding macros or programs to them.\n\nIn the general case this is not limited to Microsoft Word. Any program which has the capability of macros could be affected.",
