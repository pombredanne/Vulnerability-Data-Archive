  "Workarounds": "Disable the CVS server Until patches are available and can be applied, consider disabling the CVS server. Block or restrict access Block or restrict access to the CVS server from untrusted hosts and networks. The CVS server typically listens on 2401/tcp, but it may use another port or protocol. Limit the CVS server privileges\nConfigure CVS server to run in a restricted (chroot) environment. Run CVS servers with the minimum set of privileges required on the host file system. Provide separate systems for development (write) and public/anonymous (read-only) CVS access. Host public/anonymous CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems. Note that some of these workarounds will only limit the scope and impact of possible attacks."
