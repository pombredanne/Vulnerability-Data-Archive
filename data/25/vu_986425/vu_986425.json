  "ID": "VU#986425",
  "IDNumber": "986425",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to supply a specially crafted fragmented IPv6 packet may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause the system to crash. The attacker-supplied code would be executed in the context of the kernel.",

    "OpenBSD",
    "ICMP6 packets",
    "mbuf",
    "IPv6",
    "buffer overflow"

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from the vendor The OpenBSD development team has published patches to address this issue. Please see the System Affected section of this document for more information. Note that a second revision of the patch was released after the initial publication of this document. Users should be sure to obtain this second revision of the patch.",
