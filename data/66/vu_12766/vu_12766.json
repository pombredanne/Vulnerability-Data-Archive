  "Description": "Any program is capable of loading a COM interface and use it's functionality \nassuming that the file access conditions are met.\n\nWhenever the last client of an interface releases it, the DLL\nimplementing the interface is responsible for dropping it's reference\ncount to zero, which will cause the DLLs to be unloaded. If this count\ndoes not drop to zero, the DLL will not be unloaded and there is no\nmechanism for directly determining that any given dlls have\nactive interfaces.\n\nIf a new client starts up and requests the interface when this situation\nexists, they will not get a new instance of the interface, they will access the original instance. Any dynamic data will be new, but any cached (global/static) data will be maintained from the previous session. \n\nFurthermore, if that interface supports remote connections over the \nnetwork, it is possible that it could be accessed when the responsible \nuser is oblivious to it's being present. In short, run it once, and it \ngets to stay there and serve requests until you kill the shell, log off, \nor reboot.",
