  "Workarounds": "Workarounds AOL has published a bulletin (refer to the section titled \"AOL Instant Messenger URI Handler Buffer Overflow\") recommending the following workaround for this issue: Exploitation of aim: URI handler vulnerabilities can be prevented by removing the following key from the registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\aim\nThe following script can be saved to a file with the .vbs extension and executed to automate the task of removing the relevant URI handler: Set WshShell = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\nWshShell.RegDelete \"HKCR\\aim\\\"\nNote that this workaround is specific to users of the AIM client software for the Windows operating system. Users are strongly encouraged to apply this workaround until a patched version of the AIM client software is available."
