  "Workarounds": "Until official patches are available sites are encouraged to remove\nthe setuid and setgid permissions on the kcms_calibrate and kcms_configure\nprograms. These are typically located in /usr/openwin/bin. # chmod 400 /usr/openwin/bin/kcms_calibrate\n# chmod 400 /usr/openwin/bin/kcms_configure Note that this will remove the ability for users to run these programs."
