  "Description": "Apparently, when compiled for AIX, the X server code does not use\nstderr for its output.  Instead, it uses a hardcoded file spec of\n\"/tmp/aixfile\". This file is opened for output during server\ninitialization, without any check for prior existence. The fopen\nconveniently follows symlinks.  This, by itself, would probably\nhave been enough for exploiting; however, immediately after\nfopen(), the server issues chmod 777 on the file.",
