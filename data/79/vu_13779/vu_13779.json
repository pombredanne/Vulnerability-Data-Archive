  "Description": "We have found a serious security hole in the printing subsystem of our\nsoftware.  We are working with CERT (DARPA's Computer Emergency\nResponse Team) to formula te an appropriate public advisory; I expect\nwe'll also publish a Technical Alert.  The information will be\ndistributed to next-managers, to comp.sys.next.sysadm in, and to\nNEXTSUPP.\n\nWe might have CERT publish this stuff as early as the middle of next\nweek.",

  "Workarounds": "Remove _writers from /printers, /fax_modems, and all their immediate\nsubdirectories in all NetInfo domains on the network. If this is not\npractical, at least secure the all network-wide NetInfo domains. Remember: since _writers is *, you need neither root nor local access\nto the domain to do this. Ramifications of the Workaround (or, Why'd We Do It This Way?)\nBy allowing any user to modify /printers and /fax_modems, ordinary,\nnon-root users can define new printers and fax modems when they're\nadded to a machine. In addition, non-root users can choose to export\ntheir printer or fax modem to \u00acthe network,\u2551 and then to make\nthe printer or modem private or unavailable, without needing to\ninvolve a systems or network administrator. By removing _writers,\nusers will no longer be able to do this. And More\u255d\nVarious other directories in a NetInfo domain have _writers properties\nwith values of *. Some of these can provide holes which can be\nexploited in denial-of-service attacks. Details forthcoming, or, in\nthe short term, left as an exercise to the reader."
