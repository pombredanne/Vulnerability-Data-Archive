  "Description": "If a Netware 3.11  system has the IPTUNNEL\nNetwork Loadable Module (NLM) loaded, a DOS system with IP access to\nthat server can access the IPX network without authorization using\neither Novell's LANWorkplace for DOS or Schneider & Koch's SK-IPX/IP\nproducts and knowing the IP address of the server.  (The product does\nallow you to change the IP port number from the standard, but that is\nnot a real security feature.)",
  "ID": "VU#17479",
  "IDNumber": "17479",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Once connected the remote user can issue SLIST and other\ncommands to find out information about the IPX network that many sites\nwould not want outsiders to have knowledge. This includes listing all\nthe IPX based services available on the network (Servers, databases,\nmodems, backup systems, printers, etc.). Intruders can then lauch\nattacks on the services. This problem has been discussed a bit on comp.sys.novell with Novell replying\nthat security was not a criteria for the IPTUNNEL.",
