  "Description": "The purpose of the Desktop System Monitor subsystem is to provide a\nset of programs that monitor and report system activity.  The programs\nwork in conjunction to provide system status and report possible error\nor critical conditions.\n\nThe security vulnerability found within this set of programs\ncould allow an unprivileged user to execute any existing binary as\nother UIDs including possibly root.\n\nIt should be noted that exploit is very obscure and difficult.\nAdditionally, a local account and physical access to the console is\nrequired in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
