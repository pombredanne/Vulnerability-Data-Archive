  "Description": "CrackLib is a freely-available software library that provides\nsystems and application programmers with some control to dissuade\nusers from utilising easily-guessable passwords as authentication\ntokens.\n\nA weakness in a published version of CrackLib (v2.5, dated 1993)\nmay be open to exploitation on Unix systems utilising CrackLib in\nsetuid-root software, leading to compromise of system privileges.",
  "ID": "VU#9679",
  "IDNumber": "9679",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A bug in CrackLib v2.5 *may* be exploitable to obtain root\nprivileges when logged on machines where CrackLib is installed as\npart of a SUID program, such as \"/bin/passwd\". This problem will also impact systems where CrackLib is part of\nthe PAM (pluggable authentication module) installation; where you\nare using a commercial operating system that utilises CrackLib\n(typically this applies to some Linux and FreeBSD distributions)\nyou are advised to contact your vendor for a patch.",
