  "VendorStatement": "In a word, no, we do not suffer from this potential DoS. But, the answer is not really so straightforward. The AIX locking primitives do not allow exclusive locks on a file that\nis not open for writing. This behavior is required by POSIX\nand X/Open. However, the situation is not as simple as that. An application can\nalways take a read lock on a file that it can open for reading, and\na read lock will prevent any process from setting a write (exclusive)\nlock. So the question is really whether there are publicly readable\nfiles that must be write locked in order for some system function\nsuch as login to occur. If so, then there is a potential for denial\nof service."
