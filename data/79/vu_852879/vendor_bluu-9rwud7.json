  "VendorStatement": "\"Our XTM and Firebox appliances (our main products) are not vulnerable to these flaws, since we use openntpd rather than ntpd. Our wireless access points are not vulnerable since they only use the basic ntpclient. However, our XCS appliances (mail security) are vulnerable to the ntpd flaws. We will be releasing a firmware update to fix these flaws as soon as practical. However, in the meantime, we are sharing simple steps to mitigate this issue (use out firewall to block NTP, and point to an internal, updated NTP server instead).\""
