OVERVIEW There is a buffer overflow in mod_ssl, part of EnGarde's apache package,\n  which an attacker may potentially trigger by sending a very long client\n  certificate. DETAIL mod_ssl is an apache module used to provide SSL functionality using the\n  OpenSSL toolkit. Ed Moyle has discovered a buffer overflow in\n  mod_ssl's session caching mechanisms using dbm and shared memory. We would like to stress that this vulnerability is in mod_ssl, not in\n  apache. We are issuing an apache update because we include mod_ssl as\n  part of our apache package. SOLUTION All users should upgrade to the most recent version as outlined in\n  this advisory. Guardian Digital recently made available the Guardian Digital Secure\n  Update, a means to proactively keep systems secure and manage\n  system software. EnGarde users can automatically update their system\n  using the Guardian Digital WebTool secure interface. If choosing to manually upgrade this package, updates can be\n  obtained from: ftp://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/\n    http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/ Before upgrading the package, the machine must either: a) be booted into a \"standard\" kernel; or\n    b) have LIDS disabled. To disable LIDS, execute the command: # /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS_GLOBAL To install the updated package, execute the command: # rpm -Uvh <filename> You must now update the LIDS configuration by executing the command: # /usr/sbin/config_lids.pl To re-enable LIDS (if it was disabled), execute the command: # /sbin/lidsadm -S -- +LIDS_GLOBAL To verify the signatures of the updated packages, execute the command: # rpm -Kv <filename> UPDATED PACKAGES These updated packages are for EnGarde Secure Linux 1.0.1 (Finestra).
