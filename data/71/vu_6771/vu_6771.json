  "Description": "According to the Makefile, one of the programs should be installed\nsuid-root. This program is called `autoreply'. Using the source, I have\ndiscovered a number of serious holes, allowing any user to (among other\nthings) overwrite any arbitrary file as root. If the /.rhosts file is\nused as a target, any user can subsequently gain full root access.",
