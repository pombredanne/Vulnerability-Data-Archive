  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to control DNS responses could exploit arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on vulnerable systems. The attacker would need to be able to spoof DNS responses or control a DNS server that provides responses to a vulnerable system. Any code executed by the attacker would run with the privileges of the process that called the vulnerable resolver function, potentially root.",

  "Overview": "Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exists in the DNS stub resolver library used by BSD, ISC BIND, and GNU glibc. Other systems that use DNS resolver code derived from ISC BIND may also be affected. An attacker who is able to control DNS responses could exploit arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on vulnerable systems.",

  "Workarounds": "Use of a local caching DNS server is not an effective workaround When this document was initially published, it was thought that a caching DNS server that reconstructs DNS responses would prevent malicious code from reaching systems with vulnerable resolver libraries. This workaround does not prevent some DNS responses that contain malicious code from reaching clients, whether or not the responses are reconstructed by a local caching DNS server. Since the server may cache the responses, the malicious code could persist until the server's cache is purged or the entries expire. Disable Reverse DNS Lookups Disable the reverse DNS lookup functions in applications that perform DNS name lookups from IP addresses. For example, some HTTP and FTP servers perform reverse DNS lookups to convert IP addresses to hostnames in logs. Disabling reverse DNS lookups will only protect against specific exploit attempts that rely on the reverse lookup as an attack vector. Configure Name Service Switch (glibc only) On GNU/Linux systems using glibc, configure the Name Service Switch function of glibc not to use DNS to resolve network names and addresses. Modify the Name Service Switch configuration file /etc/nsswitch.conf so that the \"networks:\" line does not contain the term \"dns\". # This \"networks:\" line omits \"dns\" to work around a bug in glibc 2.2.5 and earlier. networks: files nisplus Note that this will prevent resolution of network names and addresses via DNS, which will likely cause resolution of non-local networks to fail."
