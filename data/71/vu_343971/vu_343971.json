  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access This diagnostic web application is designed to be used locally. Restrictions should be put in place to limit remote access. According to ABB: Unless there is a specific reason, a host based filter like the built-in firewall in Windows XP should be activated for the port 8087, denying access to the web interface from a remote location."
