  "Description": "A security vulnerability in the implementation of scoterm has been\nidentified which could allow unprivileged users to gain unauthorized\nroot access to the system.",
  "ID": "VU#15971",
  "IDNumber": "15971",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Any user with an account on the system may be able to execute arbitrary\ncommands with root privileges. A program which exploits this vulnerability is in existence, although\nwe do not believe it is currently being distributed. There is a risk\nthat the exploit method may be revealed, so the patch should be applied\nas soon as possible.",
