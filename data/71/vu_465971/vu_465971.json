  "IDNumber": "465971",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links to files on the web server and placing them in a tar file, then extracting them into the \"data bag,\" an attacker reportedly could view any file readable by the web server. By modifying these files via BSCW, the attacker may be able to overwrite files writable by the web server. Directly uploading symbolic\nlinks will not work as the BSCW software either refuses this upload with an error message or hangs on the upload.",

    "BSCW",
    "arbitrary file overwriting",
    "symlink",
    "symbolic link",
    "/tmp file",
    "temporary file"
  ],
  "Overview": "BSCW is a groupware system that runs on a web server. BSCW follows symbolic links in tar files that it extracts into a user's local area. Accessing those links may allow the user to view arbitrary files viewable by the web server, and to overwrite files writable by the web server.",
