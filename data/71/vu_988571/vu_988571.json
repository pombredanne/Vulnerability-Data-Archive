  "Keywords": [
    "Firebird",
    "integer overflow",
    "XDR protocol"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Firebird database manager contains an Integer Overflow in the processing of certain tags on the XDR protocol used for communication\nwith the server. This led the server to corrupt the process memory and crash. Repeated attempts are followed by a crash of the process in charge of restarting the database server. This may also grant attackers remote execution of arbitrary code on servers running Firebird.",
