  "Description": "CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions - CVE-2016-5672 When a user makes a network request, an app using the Crosswalk project shows an initial error message if an invalid SSL certificate is found. If the user selects \"OK\", the app then accepts all future SSL certificates without validation. The app does not make it clear that the dialog grants permanent permission to accept invalid certificates; the user is never prompted again. The researcher has released a security advisory with more information. Intel has also released a blog post about this issue.",
  "ID": "VU#217871",
  "IDNumber": "217871",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A victim user that is enticed to accept an invalid SSL certificate actually accepted invalid SSL certificates indefinitely from any source, allowing possible man-in-the-middle attacks in the future from other sources.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ssl",
    "ui",
    "CWE-356"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Intel Crosswalk project is a framework for developing hybrid apps for Android and iOS. The Crosswalk project does not properly handle SSL certificate validation when a user accepts an invalid certificate, preventing the app for validating any future SSL certificates.",
