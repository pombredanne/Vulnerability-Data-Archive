  "ID": "VU#287771",
  "IDNumber": "287771",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to send solicited IKE responses could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IKE service or cause a denial of service. The attacker must act as an IKE responder, so therefore must have control over the responder, the ability to spoof IKE response packets, or the ability to redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker.",

  "Overview": "Internet Key Exchange (IKE) implementations from several vendors contain buffer overflows and denial-of-service conditions. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",

  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict Access Using a firewall or other packet filtering technology, block or restrict access to the IKE service, 500/udp. Note that blocking access will effectively disable an IPSec-based VPN that relies on IKE for key exchange."
