  "Overview": "Reflection for Secure IT Windows Server version 6.0 uses different case sensitivity in evaluating the allow and deny lists as previous versions, potentially allowing unintended access.",
  "References": "http://support.wrq.com/techdocs/1910.html",
  "Resolution": "Upgrade According to WRQ, version 6.0, build 24 of Reflection for Secure IT Windows Server evaluates allow and deny strings in a case insensitive manner. This restores the prior behavior, but may result in user names matching the allow list that did not match in prior builds of version 6.0.",
