  "Description": "A file creation problem exists within the dtlogin program.  The\nprogram creates the file /var/dt/Xerrors as a mode 666 file.\nFurthermore, when creating this file and /var/dt/Xpid, it follows\nsymlinks.\n\nBy symlinking these two files to sensitive configuration files and\nforcing a restart on dtlogin, it is possible to gain non-authorised\nwrite access over important files.  This allows a non-privileged\nuser to under some circumstances (such as having physical access to\nthe console) to gain priviliged access.  See the Exploit field\nbelow for an example.",
  "ID": "VU#9154",
  "IDNumber": "9154",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "non-privileged users with physical access to the system console can\ngain privileged access (including uid 0), on hosts accepting CDE\nlogins, via exploiting dtlogin file creation vulnerability. Local users on the forementioned environment without physical\naccess to the system console are able to alter system behaviour and\nmight be able to gain privileged access (including uid 0) via this\nvulnerability.",
