  "Description": "UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock via Zigbee can sync up to 60,000 slave clocks located throughout a campus-area network. An administrator will typically log into the device by supplying credentials to a web-interface. These devices contain a consistent, hardcoded administrative username and password that cannot be changed by the administrator.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access\nDo not allow access to the web interface of the UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock from untrusted networks. Block Access to the Web Interface\nBlocking access to port 80/tcp will prevent any user, even authorized administrators, from logging into the web-interface, but will not interfere with the UTC Fire & Security GE-MC100-NTP/GPS-ZB Master Clock slave clock syncing."
