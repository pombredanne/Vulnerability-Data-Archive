  "Description": "From CIAC Bulletin I-079A\n\n The System Data Repository (SDR) is a SP subsystem that stores SP\nconfiguration and some operational information.  The SDR information is stored\non a Control Workstation, but is made available through a client/server\ninterface to other network-connected nodes.  In most cases, SDR interaction is\nperformed using the SDR command-line interface.  However, the \"sdrd\" daemon\nallows other nodes to make request without performing any authentication. \nThis security flaw allows anyone to use the retrieve file command to get any\nfile on the SRD system.",
