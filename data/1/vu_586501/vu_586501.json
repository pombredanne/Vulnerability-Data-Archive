  "Description": "CWE-89: Blind SQL Injection in Login Form - CVE-2017-3221\nUnauthenticated attackers having network access to the AmosConnect Server can exploit a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form to gain access to credentials stored in its internal database, containing user names and passwords. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2017-3222\nAttackers having network access to an AmosConnect server can log into it using a backdoor account that has full system privileges. Among other things, this vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges on the remote system by abusing AmosConnect Task Manager.",
  "ID": "VU#586501",
  "IDNumber": "586501",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to access or influence AmosConnect 8 email databases on computers that are installed onboard ships.",
  "Keywords": "Inmarsat\nSatellite\nAmosConnect8 \nMail Client\nAmosConnect\nsatcom",
  "Overview": "Inmarsat Solutions offers a shipboard email client service, AmosConnect 8 (AC8), which was designed to be utilized over satellite networks in a highly optimized manner. IOActive has identified two security vulnerabilities in the client software:  On-board ship network access could provide visibility of user names and passwords configured on the client device. A backdoor account has been identified in the client that provides full system privileges. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. An attacker with high skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability. AmosConnect 8 has been deemed end of life, and no longer supported. Inmarsat customers must contact Inmarsat Customer Service to obtain the replacement mail client software.",
