  "ID": "VU#888801",
  "IDNumber": "888801",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to capture an encrypted SSL/TLS session and query the server while it is using the same private RSA key that was used for the captured session could decrypt the captured session. An attacker could also forge a signature that appeared to be from the server (section 3.4).",

  "Overview": "SSL/TLS implementations that respond distinctively to an incorrect PKCS #1 v1.5 encoded SSL/TLS version number expose the premaster secret to a modified Bleichenbacher attack. An attacker could decrypt a given SSL/TLS session or forge a signature on behalf of a vulnerable application's private RSA key.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. In order to defeat this specific attack, an SSL/TLS server must not respond distinctively when a premaster secret sent by the client contains an incorrect or unexpected SSL/TLS version number. The paper recommends that an SSL/TLS server always replace the client-provided version number with the expected version number as determined from either the Client hello or Server hello messages (section 6.2).",

  "Workarounds": "Manage private keys Use different private keys for different applications and servers and change keys as appropriate for your site and security policy. An attacker cannot decrypt a premaster secret encrypted with one RSA key by querying a server that uses a different key. Monitor SSL/TLS applications and servers Monitor RSA applications and servers for signs of attack. In the case of an attack against SSL/TLS web servers, logs may show a relatively high number of network connections and failed attempts to establish SSL/TLS sessions. Depending on baseline performance, servers may show increased CPU usage or an above average number of network connections."
