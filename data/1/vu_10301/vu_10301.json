  "Description": "The hole is caused by the fact that the printer spooling subsystem\n(lpd) needs to access a priviliged port and therefore must run as\nroot.  This causes NeWSprint (which is run by lpd) to be run as root.\n\nThe language accepted by NeWSprint includes a command with syntax\n\n<string> runprogram\n\nwhich can be used by any user to let NeWSprint run a command.",
