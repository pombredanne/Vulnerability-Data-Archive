  "Description": "The PolyVision RoomWizard is a touch screen scheduling device with a web-based administrative interface. The Sync Connector feature allows the RoomWizard to communicate with Microsoft Exchange in an Microsoft Windows Actitve Directory (AD) environment. The Sync Connector AD credentials are disclosed in the content of a web page on the administrative interface. This vulnerability has been reported to be affected in RoomWizard firmware version 3.2.3. An additional issue exists in that the RoomWizard ships with a default password on the administrator account permitting console access via HTTP.",
  "ID": "VU#870601",
  "IDNumber": "870601",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with HTTP access to a RoomWizard device and knowledge of the administrative password could obtain the AD credentials. The attacker could also modify settings, including network configuration, which could prevent legitimate users from accessing the RoomWizard device.",

  "Overview": "The PolyVision RoomWizard web based scheduling system with touch screen display contains two vulnerabilities that allow an unauthorized user to access the device console and Sync Connector Active Directory credentials.",
  "References": "http://steelcase.polyvision.com/support/downloads-roomwiz.asp",
  "Resolution": "Change default passwords Change the default administrative password before deploying RoomWizard devices in an production environment. Upgrade It has been reported to us that RoomWizard firmware version 3.2.3 is affected by this vulnerability. PolyVision was unable to reproduce the Sync Connector AD credentials vulnerability utilizing the latest revisions of the Room Wizard firmware, version 3.5. PolyVision recommends all RoomWizard devices be upgraded to the latest version of firmware.",
