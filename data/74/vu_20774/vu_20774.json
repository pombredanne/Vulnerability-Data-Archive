  "Description": "(this is from http://www.c2.org/~aelana/javascript.html)\n\nNetscape's new Java inline langauge, nice idea, but is it safe? /can/\nit be safe and still be functional? Here are some examples that make\nJavaScript give someone access to information you may not want to give\nout, any time you access a page.... These were functional for 2.0b5 for\nHPUX... these should function on any 2.0b5, more than likely would\nfunction on 2.0b4 and 2.0b3 on any platform since they make use of only\nJavaScript holes not implemantion specific holes. I have attemptest to\ntest the second example (disk-cache) and so far it seems that HPUX is\nthe only platform on which it works, the first and third however work\non Win3.1 and DEC Alpha and should work on anything.\n\nAll these demos pop up a window to display what the thing is doing, in\nall these cases, if I were actually trying to snoop on somone, these\nwindows can be masked and/or substituted by using a hidden frame (1 x\n1pixel frame or off screen with a document.write(\"\"); (which clears the\nscreen effectivly). They close automatically when completed.\n\nClick on any of the following links and look in the resulting text area\nbelow.. that text area could easily be hidden and told in javascript to\nautomatically submit a form to any cgi... right now it only shows the\nresults on screen.\n\nPersonally I feel the most disturbing of these is the first one, as it\nallows anyone to get an entire map of your hard drive w/o you knowing\nincluding allowing them to read your bookmarks file w/o much difficulty\n(all you would do is using the method detailed in the example specify\nthe location of the bookmark and read the links from that.",
