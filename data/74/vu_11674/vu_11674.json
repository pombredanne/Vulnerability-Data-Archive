  "Description": "Here is a description of the variations that have been problems in\none implementation or another.\n\n1) \"From:\" field is a program (e.g. \"|mail me < /etc/passwd\"), \"To:\"\nfield is a user that does not exist.\n\n2) Same as above but with a \"To:\" field pointing to a file.  (This works\non some systems that #1 fails on.)  Sendmail may issue an error\nmessage, but the vulnerability works anyway.\n\n3) Same as #1 and #2, but only from the localhost.  That is, remote users\ncannot exploit the problem, only local users via \"telnet localhost 25\".\nThis limits the impact to local users being able to access the\n\"daemon\" account (however damaging that might be).\n\n4) Similar to above but with a \"Return-Receipt\" field that is incorrect\nand an \"Errors-To\" field that is a program.  Although the\nReturn-Receipt field is checked, the Errors-To field is not.\n\n5) Same as above but instead of sending to localhost, the mail is sent to\n[127.0.0.2] so that it is queued.  When the mail eventually times\nout, a mail reply is generated and sent to the bogus From field.\n\n6) a \"new\" problem I understand you and smb are working on involving\npipes, but I don't have details.\n\nYou've said 8.6.3 fixes #1, #2, and I assume #3, and that 8.6.4 will fix #4.\n\nI'm glad you figured out why it isn't in 5.65 (does that include all\nthe variants?), but unfortunately I'm getting a sufficiently mixed reaction\nfrom different vendors (e.g. #3 above) that I have no confidence that\ndifferent vendors have not modified whatever sendmail they started with\nin a way to (re)introduce the problem if it wasn't already there.\nSo I'm trying to get word out about all the above to vendors so they\ncan check for sure.  I'd appreciate any additions to the list you have.\n\n8.6.4 fixes several security problems.  Sites should upgrade\nto this version.\n\nCA-93:16 and 16a issued",
