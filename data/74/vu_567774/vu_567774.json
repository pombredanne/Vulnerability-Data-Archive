  "Description": "Dell SecureWorks' SWRX-2011-001 advisory states: \"A vulnerability exists in Imperva SecureSphere due to improper validation of user-controlled input. User-controllable input is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious content prior to being stored and later returned to an administrator in dynamically generated web content. Remote attackers could leverage this issue to conduct persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When the malicious content is viewed, arbitrary script or HTML code injected into the affected database field will be executed in the SecureSphere administrative user\u2019s browser session in the security context of the SecureSphere administrative GUI. Successful exploitation may aid an attacker in retrieving session cookies, stealing recently submitted data, or launching further attacks.\" Additional details can be found in Imperva's advisory, Imperva Security Response for CVE-2011-0767.",
