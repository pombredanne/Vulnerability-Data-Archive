  "Description": "Any 4.1.x customers who are currently running an FCS\n(unpatched) sendmail may need to change sendmail configuration\nfiles on \"subsidiary\" systems when installing 100377-08. This\nis because the interpretation of the \"%y\" operator underwent a\nsmall undocumented change in sendmail patch 100377-04.\n\nIn addition, those 4.1.x customers who implemented workarounds\nin response to that change---which many did not encounter until\nthey installed the highly publicized 100377-07--may wish to\nadapt the configuration files to use the new \"%l\" operator.\nHowever, any configuration file which worked correctly under\n100377-07 will continue to work under -08.\n\nNo configuration file changes are needed on Solaris 2.x\nsystems.",

  "Workarounds": "SMRSH program by Eric Allman\nUpdate 11/19/93: Thinks have fixed queued problem. Working on IFS & other environment variables. Mark believes\nhe's convinced them to take out all environment variables. Apparently in the past they had taken them all out but got\nlots of customer complaints so put them back in. Will issue a beta test 11/22 to Weitse, Casper Dik, Spafford,\nand us. Will also touch base with Eric Allman. Then they will\nredo the patch with any input from folks before releasing it."
