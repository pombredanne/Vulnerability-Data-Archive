  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Any user with access to the share can modify ScriptLogic log records. Additionally, an intruder can consume disk space, introduce malicious code, or store unauthorized files on the open share. This vulnerability, when used in conjunction with other, unrelated vulnerabilities, could allow an intruder to invoke malicious code they have stored on the open share. Consumption of excessive disk space may also interfere with or halt the ordinary operation of the system housing the LOGS$ share. The ability to use a network share for logging is an optional feature in the ScriptLogic software. Sites that have not configured logging to a network share are not affected by this vulnerability. Sites that have selected to log to an alternate network share with restricted access may be at a reduced risk for this vulnerability, depending on their environment.",
