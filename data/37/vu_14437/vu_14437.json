  "Description": "From Network Associates Security Advisory:\n\nThe \"chpass\" command allows unprivileged users to edit database\ninformation associated with their account. Chpass assembles a collection\nof information that can be edited in a file, allows the user to modify it\nwith the editor of their choice, and then commits the modified information\nback to the password database.\n \nChpass is an SUID program. It functions by creating a temporary copy of\nthe password database, spawning an editor to display and modify user\naccount information, and then committing the information into the\ntemporary password file copy, which is then used to rebuild the password\ndatabase.\n \nIn OpenBSD 2.3, an implementation flaw causes the temporary password file\ncopy to become accessible to the spawned editor process and its children.\nAn attacker can use this access to modify the information in the temporary\ncopy. The tainted copy is used to rebuild the password database, allowing\nthe attacker to modify \"root\"'s account information and gain superuser\naccess.",
