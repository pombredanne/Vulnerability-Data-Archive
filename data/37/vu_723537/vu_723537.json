  "Impact": "There are varying impacts depending on the version of FrontPage Server Extensions running on the vulnerable host. If a user is running FrontPage Server Extensions 2000, an attacker can cause denial-of-service conditions on the web server (cause the web server to become unavailable). If a user is running FrontPage Server Extensions 2002, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the web server.",
