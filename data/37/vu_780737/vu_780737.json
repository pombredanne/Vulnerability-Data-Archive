  "Impact": "An attacker can construct a message with a crafted From: header that will cause Pine to crash with a segmentation fault, possibly resulting in a core dump. Pine users may be unable to restart the application if messages containing the crafted From: headers appear in mailboxes that Pine is configured to check at startup. Additionally, it may be possible for intruders to execute code on the heap of systems using vulnerable versions of the software. The code would be executed in the context of the user running the Pine program.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds It may be possible to filter messages containing headers that exploit this vulnerability before they are delivered to mailboxes that Pine reads by using a tool such as Procmail or Sieve. Users of vulnerable versions of Pine may be able to delete existing messages containing the malicious From: headers either manually or from another mail client."
