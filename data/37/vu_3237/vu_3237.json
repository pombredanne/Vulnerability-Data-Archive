  "Description": "Description of the problem in all versions of\nCalendar Manager preceeding version V4.0-10\n\n. Calendar Manager's startup procedure installs images with enhanced\nprivileges. Installing images with privileges is a frequently used\nway to share information between users in a VMS environment.\n. A method that exploits these installed images in an unintended\nmanner has been discovered, giving rise to security problems.\n. removing privileges from the installed images seriously restricts\nthe functionality of the software.",
  "ID": "VU#3237",
  "IDNumber": "3237",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Effectively this opens up a VAX/VMS system to methods that can obtain\nfull privileges for any user with access to Calendar Manager.",

  "Workarounds": "Russell has not given any workarounds although PTT Research has been\nnagging them quite seriously. PTT Research itself has run Cal Man for\na short time with restricted privileges. But this makes the core\nof the product, inter-user agenda scheduling, unusable. It is almost like\nnot using Cal Man at all."
