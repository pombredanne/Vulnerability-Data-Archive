  "Description": "J2k-Codec is a JPEG 2000 decoding library for Windows. J2k-Codec contains multiple exploitable exploitable vulnerabilities that can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "ID": "VU#345337",
  "IDNumber": "345337",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to process a specially-crafted JPEG 2000 image with J2k-Codec, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the library.",

  "Workarounds": "Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0 on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will."
