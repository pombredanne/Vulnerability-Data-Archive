  "Resolution": "Upgrade or apply an update or patch\nUpdates for affected authoring tools have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. Note that this section is not complete, vendors that create vulnerable Flash authoring tools may not be listed. Vulnerable Flash files must be regenerated after the affected authoring tools have been updated. Adobe has included mitigations in Flash Player to block attacks against some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Flash files (APSB07-20).",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Until patches can be applied and affected Flash files regenerated, website owners may wish to remove automatically generated Flash files or at least serve automatically generated Flash files from \"safe\" domains, such as numbered IP addresses. Developers of applications that save to SWF are encouraged to perform proper input validation on all user definable variables used in URL loading ActionScript functions and the htmlText variable. Specifically,\nWhitelist protocol handlers to allow only \"http:\" and \"https:\" in all URL loading functions. Whitelist characters in user definable input when used in getURL(). Do not rely on escape(). When feasible, only allow alphanumeric characters. Whitelist and/or HTML entity encode user input in htmlText. Load SWF files from relative URLs. The relative URL should not contain \"..\"."
