  "Description": "IntelliCom NetBiter devices are based on HMS Anybus technology. The HMS HICP protocol (3250/udp) provides a way to configure network settings for NetBiter and possibly other Anybus-based devices. The NetBiter Config HICP configuration utility (NetbiterConfig.exe) has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted hostname (hn) value. Further details are available in the original post by Rub\u00e9n Santamarta.",
