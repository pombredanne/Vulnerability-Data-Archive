  "Description": "The file /etc/syslog.pid is world writeable.\n\nIn the sh script, /usr/lib/newsyslog, which is run indirectly from\ncron, as root, to manage system log files,  there is a call to\nsend a HANGUP signal to the process id that is contained in the\n/etc/syslog.pid file.",
  "ID": "VU#18837",
  "IDNumber": "18837",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This set's up the possiblity that someone could write any PID number(s)\ninto the file, and have the system send it/them a HUP signal, whenever\n/usr/lib/newsyslog is run. Of the standard system processes, (ie. files started by the default\n/etc/rc*), preliminary tests suggest that lpd, is the only service that\nwill exit when it gets a HUP signal. The real threat is to user login shells\nand user programs that do not have signal handling routines and are not\nrunning \"set nohup\". Other possible problems could result in the fact that many programs\nreread their configuration files upon receiving a HUP signal. If daemon\nconfiguration files are modified, these changes could be acted upon\nthrough this possible vulnerability. Of particular interest would\nbe named and init.",
