  "Workarounds": "Until the update for this issue can be applied, the following workarounds may reduce the chances of exploitation. Use Least Privilege Where possible, grant users the fewest privileges needed to perform necessary tasks. Adding or removing privileges from roles may impact system functionality. Instead, privileges should be administered on a per-user basis. Change login credentials for default Oracle accounts Oracle creates numerous default accounts when it is installed. Upon installation, accounts that are not needed should be disabled and the login credentials for needed accounts should be changed."
