  "ID": "VU#747736",
  "IDNumber": "747736",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links named for the files that vi creates, an intruder may overwrite any file writable by the user of vi. Since the intruder cannot control the content of the overwritten files, it does not seem likely that an increase in privilege will result.",

  "Overview": "The implementation of vi, a text editor, provided with SCO Openunix creates insecure temporary files with predictable names. Using a symbolic link attack, an intruder can  overwrite any file writable by the user of vi.",
