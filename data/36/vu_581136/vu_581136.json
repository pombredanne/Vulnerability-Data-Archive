  "Description": "Vulnerability 1: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of InduSoft Web Studio. The vulnerability exists within the remote agent component (CEServer.exe) that listens by default on Port 4322/TCP. When handling incoming requests, the process fails to perform any type of authentication. Vulnerability 2: This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of InduSoft Web Studio. This vulnerability exists within the CEServer component, which is used as a runtime dependency for deployed applications that use InduSoft Web Studio. When handling the remove file operation (0x15), the process blindly copies user-supplied data to a fixed-length buffer on the stack. For additional information see ICSA-11-319-01.",
