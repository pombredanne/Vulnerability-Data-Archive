  "Description": "According to ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-11-094-01: According to the researcher\u2019s report, the InBatch client ActiveX control will connect to an InBatch server via TCP. If an attacker successfully employs social engeneering (i.e., phishing e-mail), the user could be connected to a malicious server. Once connected to this server, the InBatch client ActiveX is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could allow a DoS or possibly lead to arbitrary code execution.",
