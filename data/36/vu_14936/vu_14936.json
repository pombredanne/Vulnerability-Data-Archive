  "Description": "Normally, a remote (network) file system is mounted by requesting the\nmount daemon on the machine on which the file system resides to perform\na mount RPC. The result of this RPC is the file handle of the root\nremote file system. As a security measure the mount daemon checks the\nsource machine of the request against a list of allowable machines\n(this list is found in /etc/exports). If the requester's machine is not\nin the export list, the mount RPC will of course fail.\n\nHowever, a special (defined) feature of the portmapper allows you to\ncircumvent this check.  The portmapper provides an indirect (or proxy)\nRPC service.  This service is very simple, in that you provide the parameters\nof the RPC request, send them to the portmapper and it will make the RPC call\nfor you.  This feature allows you to perform indirect RPC mount calls.  Since\nthe source of the request (from the mount daemon's point of view) is his local\nmachine such a request is often granted.  This will only work if the local\nmachine is mentioned in the export list for its own exportable file systems,\nbut with netgroup facilities this is often the case.",

  "Impact": "A known security risk in using NFS is that someone can obtain a file\nhandle and access NFS files from an unauthorized machine. This problem\nstill exists in most NFS implementations from other vendors.",
