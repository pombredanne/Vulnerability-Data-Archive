  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Microsoft lists the following workaround in MS04-011: Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below. Block ports 443 and 636 at the firewall\nPort 443 is used to receive SSL traffic. Port 636 is used for LDAP SSL connections (LDAPS). Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Other ports may be found that could be used to exploit this vulnerability. However, the ports listed here are the most common attack vectors. Microsoft recommends blocking all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. Impact of Workaround: If ports 443 or 636 are blocked, the affected systems can no longer accept external connections using SSL or LDAPS."
