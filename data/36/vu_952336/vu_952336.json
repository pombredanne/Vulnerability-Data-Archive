  "Workarounds": "<H4> Workarounds</H4>\nAll affected versions of IIS/Indexing Services can be protected against exploits of this vulnerbility by removing script mappings for for Internet Data Administration (.ida) and Internet Data Query (.idq) files. However, Microsoft makes no guarantees such mappings will not be recreated when installing other related software components. Users of beta copies of Windows XP should upgrade to a newer version of the software when it becomes available."
