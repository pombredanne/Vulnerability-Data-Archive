  "Description": "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2014-4872\nBMC Track-It! exposes several dangerous remote .NET services on port 9010 without authentication. .NET remoting allows a user to invoke methods remotely and retrieve their result. The exposed service FileStorageService allows for arbitrary file upload and code execution. The exposed service ConfigurationService allows for retrieval of configuration files which contain both application and domain credentials. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2014-4873\nAn authenticated user can engage in blind SQL Injection by entering comparison operators in the POST string for the /TrackItWeb/Grid/GetData page. CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls - CVE-2014-4874\nA remote authenticated user can download arbitrary files on the /TrackItWeb/Attachment page. The vendor, BMC, has issued the following statement: BMC has issued an advisory to all Track-IT customers with the details of the disclosed vulnerabilities and the availability of hotfixes. Resolved issues: CWE-89: SQL Injection - CVE-2014-4873\nHotfix available\nSee Article ID TIA07454 on Numara support site\nCWE-264: Arbitrary file download - CVE-2014-4874\nHotfix available\nSee Article ID TIA07453 on Numara support site\nResolutions under development: CWE-306: Improper Authentication for .NET services - CVE-2014-4872\nUntil hotfixes are available we recommend that you block all communications from untrusted networks to TCP/UDP ports 9010 to 9020. This will also block SelfService and trackitweb from being used from external networks. See Articles TIA07456, TIA07457. And TIA07455 for current status\nIf you have any questions regarding this security notification, please contact Track-It! Support by opening a case at: https://support.numarasoftware.com/ The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-4872.",
