  "Resolution": "Upgrade According to ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-11-103-01A: Honeywell Environmental Combustion and Control (ECC) SymmetrE customers should use the following link to obtain the updated version of Web Toolkit ScanServer component build 862.1.10.1. Users should install this update on the SymmetrE server and workstation clients following the Software Release Bulletin instructions. Once installed, clients will receive the updated ActiveX control when they connect to the SymmetrE web page. The update can be found here: https://extranet.honeywell.com/ecc/TheBuildingsForum under the \u201cXL5000 \u2013 SymmetrE\u201d section. Note that access to this website requires registeration. Any user who has installed and used the Web Toolkit to create a webpage for users\u2019 access should apply this update to their SymmetrE server and workstation clients, then reconnect visiting clients to obtain the updated ActiveX control on those clients as soon as possible. For more information, customers should contact Honeywell ECC support in their region. Honeywell Building Solutions (HBS) customers should contact their local account manager to arrange for updates to be applied by HBS service technicians onsite.",
