  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to gain access to the perform TFTP operations. These operations include: - inspection of configuration data\n- recovery and setting of passwords\n- inspection and updates to the firmware\n- destructive updates to the firmware\n- malicious custom updates to the firmware Note that affected Alcatel ADSL modems do not provide any mechanism for determining the validity of firmware updates, so a remote attacker may be able to install custom firmware that operated as a DDoS client or a network sniffer. Similarly, an attacker could produce an invalid firmware revision that would disable the device completely, leaving victims no alternative but to return the disabled unit to the manufacturer.",

  "Overview": "The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has recently discovered several vulnerabilities in the Alcatel Speed Touch line of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. These vulnerabilities are the result of weak authentication and access control policies and result in one or more of the following impacts: unauthorized access, unauthorized monitoring, information leakage, denial of service, and permanent disability of affected devices. The SDSC has published additional information regarding these vulnerabilities at http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/.",

  "Resolution": "Block malicious traffic at your network perimeter If you have a home firewall product you may be able to prevent the TFTP UDP bounce attack by filtering one or more of the following types of traffic: - Packets with spoofed source addresses\n- Packets with a source address of 255.255.255.255\n- Packets with a destination port of echo (or other \"simple\" services)",
