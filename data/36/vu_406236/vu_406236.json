  "Workarounds": "Do not open untrusted documents Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Publisher or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip ST04-010 for more information. Do not rely on file name extension filtering In most cases, Windows will call Publisher to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Publisher. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .pub, .doc, .dot, .rtf) may not detect all Publisher documents."
