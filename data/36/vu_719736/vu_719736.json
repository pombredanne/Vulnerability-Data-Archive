  "Description": "The Fisher-Price Smart Toy bear is a new WiFi-connected Internet of Things (IoT) toy. The device utilizes network connectivity to provide more interactivity with children. CWE-287: Improper Authentication - CVE-2015-8269 The Fisher-Price Smart Toy uses a predictable account number which may allow an attacker that has signed up for the Fisher-Price Smart Toy platform to perform some queries and commands on other accounts. Such queries may allow an attacker to learn name, birthday, gender, and other details of the user. An attacker may also edit some personal details, and re-associate the toy to a different account. According to the researchers at Rapid7, not all data is modifiable or reachable, somewhat mitigating the impact: Furthermore, the researcher notes the Smart Toy is based on Android 4.4 (KitKat). It is currently not clear if the platform is updated with the latest Android security patches. For more information, please see Rapid7's security advisory. Mattel, Inc., has provided the following statement: \"We recently learned of a security vulnerability with our Fisher-Price WiFi-connected Smart Toy Bear. We have remediated the situation and have no reason to believe that customer information was accessed by any unauthorized person. Mattel and Fisher-Price take the safety of our consumers and their personal data very seriously, which is why we act quickly to resolve potential vulnerabilities like this.'",
