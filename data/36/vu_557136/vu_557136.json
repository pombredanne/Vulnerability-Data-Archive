  "Overview": "Cayman gateways ship without a default password on the admin and user accounts. As long as the gateway is not addressable via the WAN, this can only be accessed and set by anyone on the LAN side. With admin access, the gateway settings can be configured by an intruder.",
  "References": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3017",
  "Resolution": "Set a password for your ADSL modem on both the admin and user accounts. According to Cayman, this is done at the request of Cayman customers (major broadband service providers) and is considered to be the end user's responsibility to set.",
