  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Restrict access\nBlocking the SMB protocol at the network perimeter will reduce exposure to this vulnerability. Servers using the SMB protocol typically use ports 139/tcp and 445/tcp. Disable unnecessary daemons\nDo not enable the smbd daemon on systems that do not need to use the SMB protocol. Some operating systems have the smbd daemon started by default."
