  "Workarounds": "Manually remove UploadServlet class\nAccording to the Cisco Advisory, users may perform the following steps to manually apply the patch: Manual Instructions to Patch CCS 3.x Stop Internet Information Server (IIS). Run Winzip or your favorite zip utility and open ServletExec22.jar in the C:\\Program Files\\new atlanta\\servletexec ISAPI\\lib directory. Delete UploadServlet.class. Save ServletExec22.jar back to its original location and exit Winzip. Restart IIS. Manual Instructions to Patch CCS 4.x Stop Internet Information Server (IIS). Run Winzip or your favorite zip utility and open ServletExec30.jar in the C:\\Program Files\\new atlanta\\servletexec ISAPI\\lib directory. Delete UploadServlet.class. Save ServletExec30.jar back to its original location and exit Winzip. Restart IIS. CCS 5.x is not vulnerable and these manual instructions do not apply."
