  "Description": "CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CVE-2014-3829\nCentreon version 2.5.1 and Centreon Enterprise Server version 2.2 are vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe handling of session_id and template_id variables in displayServiceStatus.php and insufficient filtering on the command_line variable. The underlying operating system is then able to interpolate special characters, allowing for arbitrary commands to be injected. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') -  CVE-2014-3828\nCentreon version 2.5.1 and Centreon Enterprise Server version 2.2 are vulnerable to SQL injection in the following php components: http://server/centreon/include/views/graphs/common/makeXML_ListMetrics.php\nhttp://server/centreon/include/views/graphs/GetXmlTree.php\nhttp://server/centreon/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php\nhttp://server/centreon/include/configuration/configObject/traps/GetXMLTrapsForVendor.php\nhttp://server/centreon/include/common/javascript/commandGetArgs/cmdGetExample.php\nhttp://server/centreon/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php Rapid7 reports that prior versions back to 2.0 may be affected. See the Rapid7 advisory for more details.",
