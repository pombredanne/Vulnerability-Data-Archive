  "Description": "CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision, CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores Web servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context may assign client request Proxy header values to internal HTTP_PROXY environment variables. The vulnerable behavior is the result of a naming convention for meta-variables, defined in RFC 3876, which leads to a name collision: \"The HTTP header field name is converted to upper case, has all occurrences of \"-\" replaced with \"_\" and has \"HTTP_\" prepended to give the meta-variable name.\" According to the researchers, a web server is vulnerable if: A web server, programming language or framework (and in some limited situations the application itself) sets the environmental variable HTTP_PROXY from the user supplied Proxy header in the web request, or sets a similarly used variable (essentially when the request header turns from harmless data into a potentially harmful environmental variable). A web application makes use of HTTP_PROXY or similar variable unsafely (e.g. fails to check the request type) resulting in an attacker controlled proxy being used (essentially when HTTP_PROXY is actually used unsafely). By sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to conduct MITM attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. For more information, refer to httpoxy.org.",

  "Workarounds": "Filter Proxy request headers The researchers and community have identified several filtering strategies that are product-dependent: Apache/CGI In this configuration, any language may be vulnerable (the HTTP_PROXY env var is \"real\"). If you are using mod_headers , you can unset the \"Proxy\" header with this directive: RequestHeader unset Proxy If you are using mod_security, you can use a rule like (vary the action to taste): SecRuleEngine On\n    SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy \"@gt 0\"\n    \"id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'\" Refer to Apache's response for more information. HAProxy httprequest delheader Proxy lighttpd <= 1.4.40 (reject requests containing \"Proxy\" header) Create \"/path/to/deny-proxy.lua\", read-only to lighttpd, with content: if (lighty.request[\"Proxy\"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end Modify lighttpd.conf to load mod_magnet and run lua code server.modules += ( \"mod_magnet\" )\n    magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( \"/path/to/deny-proxy.lua\" ) lighttpd2 (development) (strip \"Proxy\" header from request) Add to lighttpd.conf: req_header.remove \"Proxy\"; Nginx/FastCGI Use this to block the Proxy header from being passed on to PHPFPM, PHPPM, etc. fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY \"\"; Nginx with proxy_pass The following setting should work for people who are using \"proxy_pass\" with nginx: proxy_set_header Proxy \"\"; Microsoft has provided the following guidance for IIS servers utilizing affected third-party frameworks: Microsoft IIS Mitigation steps: Update apphost.config with the following rule: <system.webServer> <rewrite> <rules> <rule name=3D\"Erase HTTP_PROXY\" patternSyntax=3D\"Wildcard\"> <match url=3D\"*.*\" /> <serverVariables> <set name=3D\"HTTP_PROXY\" value=3D\"\" /> </serverVariables> <action type=3D\"None\" /> </rule> </rules> </rewrite> </system.webServer>"
