  "Workarounds": "Encrypt connections between NuPoint and Exchange Servers If the MAPI protocol is enabled, connections from the NuPoint server will be encrypted. Using IPSec or some other VPN technology to encrypt the connection between the NuPoint and Exchange server will mitigate this vulnerability. Restrict access The NuPoint Messenger server should not use IMAP to connect to remote Exchange servers. If IMAP is enabled, the NuPoint server should be directly connected to the same isolated network as the Exchange server that it is communicating with."
