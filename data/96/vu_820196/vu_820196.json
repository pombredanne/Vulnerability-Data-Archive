  "Description": "According to the Furuno VDR product page, the VDR \"records all crucial data to identify the cause of maritime casualty as well as contribute to the future prevention of the catastrophe of any kind.\" Multiple versions of Furuno VDR VR-3000/VR-3000S and VR-7000 contain a firmware update utility called moduleserv that listens on TCP port 10110. The moduleserv service fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, which an unauthenticated attacker may leverage to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. For more information, refer to the blog post by IOActive.",
