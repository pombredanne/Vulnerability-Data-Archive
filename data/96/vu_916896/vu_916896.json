  "Description": "Oracle Outside In is a set of libraries that can decode over 500 different file formats. Originally written by Stellent, Outside In is now part of Oracle. The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by a variety of applications, including Microsoft Exchange, Google Search Appliance, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, and Novell Groupwise. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2015-6013, CVE-2015-6014, CVE-2015-6015 The Outside In library for processing WK4, Doc, and Paradox DB data contains stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The mapping of Oracle IDs to CVEs to underlying bugs is as follows: S0618114 - CVE-2015-6013: Oracle Outside In 8.5.2 WK4 stack buffer overflow\nS0618133 - CVE-2015-6014: Oracle Outside In 8.5.2 DOC stack buffer overflow\nS0618122 - CVE-2015-6015:Oracle OIT 8.5.2 Paradox DB stack buffer overflow",
  "ID": "VU#916896",
  "IDNumber": "916896",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By causing an application to process a specially-crafted file with the Oracle Outside In library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Outside In, this may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all.",
  "Keywords": "BFF",
  "Overview": "Oracle Outside In versions 8.5.2 and earlier contain stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the parsers for WK4, Doc, and Paradox DB files, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
  "References": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2016-2367955.html",
  "Resolution": "Apply an update This vulnerability is addressed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware version provided by the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January update.",
