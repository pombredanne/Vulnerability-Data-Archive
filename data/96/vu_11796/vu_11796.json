  "Description": "One of our system administrators has discovered a potential security\nproblem involving SPARC SunOS machines with FDDI interfaces.  The FDDI\ninstall script that is used to setup an FDDI sbus card creates a file\ncalled /etc/loadable.  This file is executed from rc.local to\ninitialize the FDDI interface.  The FDDI install script is generally\nrun when the system is in single user mode. The script does a change\nmode command\n\nchmod u+x /etc/loadable\n\nTo make the file executable but since the default umask in single user\nmode creates the file with permissions set to 666 the result is a file\nexecuted by rc.local with 766 permissions.  Obviously, if the system's\n/.profile had a umask of 022 things would be ok but to be safe, I\nwould recommend that the install script set the permissions explicitly\nwith\n\nchmod 744 /etc/loadable",
