  "Description": "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key -- CVE-2015-8288 The firmware for these devices contains a hard-coded RSA private key, as well as a hard-coded X.509 certificate and key. An attacker with knowledge of these keys could gain administrator access to the device, implement man-in-the-middle attacks, or decrypt passively captured packets. CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel -- CVE-2015-8289 A remote attacker able to access the /cgi-bin/passrec.asp password recovery page may be able to view the administrator password in clear text by opening the source code of above page. According to the reporter, these vulnerabilities affect firmware versions 1.0.0.47 and 1.0.0.49 running on Netgear model D6000 and D3600. Other models and firmware versions may also be impacted.",
