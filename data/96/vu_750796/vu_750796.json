  "Description": "Liferay Portal is a web portal that can provide Java applets that adhere to the JSR 168 portlet specification. Liferay is available as a free community-supported version and also a commercial enterprise version. Liferay Portal fails to properly sanitize data that is provided by the p_p_id parameter, which can be provided without authentication as part of an HTTP GET request. The provided data is placed into a database, where it can be displayed to an administrator in another page, such as the Plugins Configuration section of the Control Panel. This allows for persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).",
