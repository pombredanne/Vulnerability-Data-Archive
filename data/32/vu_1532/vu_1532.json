  "Description": "There exists a security hole in /usr/kvm/crash that can allow any user\nto gain group \"kmem\" access.  Once the user has kmem access s/he can\naccess the following special files:\n\ncrw-r-----  1 root     kmem       3,   0 Apr  8 19:39 /dev/mem\ncrw-r-----  1 root     kmem       3,   1 Sep  2 11:49 /dev/kmem\ncrw-r-----  1 root     kmem       7,   0 Feb 17  1991 /dev/drum\ncrw-r-----  1 root     kmem      41,   0 Jul 30 03:07 /dev/dump\ncrw-r-----  1 root     kmem       3,  11 Jul  9  1991 /dev/eeprom\n\nNote that crash allows you to shell out, and that it fails to reset the\neffective group ID before spawning the subshell.",

Ken Pon says many of the 100103-10 patches did not make it into 4.2. 100103-11 is now available. In response to our advisory, several\nfolks have noted some (minor) problems with it. The e-mail is filed\nin case folks complain that the script aborts on them."
