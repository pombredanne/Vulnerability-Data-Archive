  "Addendum": "The following advisory has been issued in regards to this problem: ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20010501-01-P -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- SGI Security Advisory Title:     IRIX rpc.espd Buffer Overflow\n        Reference: CVE CAN-2001-0331\n        Number:    20010501-01-P\n        Date:      May 9, 2001 SGI provides this information freely to the SGI user community for its \nconsideration, interpretation, implementation and use. SGI recommends \nthat this information be acted upon as soon as possible. SGI provides the information in this Security Advisory on an \"AS-IS\" basis \nonly, and disclaims all warranties with respect thereto, express, implied \nor otherwise, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability \nor fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall SGI be liable for \nany loss of profits, loss of business, loss of data or for any indirect, \nspecial, exemplary, incidental or consequential damages of any kind arising \nfrom your use of, failure to use or improper use of any of the instructions \nor information in this Security Advisory. - --- Issue Specifics --- Embedded Support Partner (ESP) is an infrastructure that is integrated \ninto the IRIX operating system for the purposes of support. Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force has reported that an exploitable \nbuffer overflow has been discovered in ESP daemon rpc.espd which can\nlead to a root compromise. SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for \nneutralizing the exposure. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures \nbe implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems. This issue has been corrected \nin ESP 2.0 for IRIX 6.5.9 and above. - --- Impact --- The ESP(1) platform is installed by default on IRIX 6.5.5 and above. IRIX 6.5.5 through IRIX 6.5.8 are vulnerable. IRIX 6.5.7 and IRIX 6.5.8 systems with patch 4123 are not vulnerable. IRIX 6.5.9 and above are not vulnerable to this issue. A local user account on the vulnerable system is not required in order \nto exploit rpc.espd daemon. The rpc.espd daemon can be exploited remotely\nover an untrusted network. The exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to a root compromise. This rpc.espd buffer overflow vulnerability was reported by ISS X-Force: http://xforce.iss.net/ The CVE candidate for this vulnerability is: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0331 - --- Temporary Solution --- Although patches are available for this issue, it is realized that\nthere may be situations where installing the patches immediately may\nnot be possible. The steps below can be used to disable the rpc.espd daemon to prevent \nexploitation of this vulnerability until patches can be installed. 1) Become the root user on the system. % /bin/su -\n                Password: 2) Change the permissions on the rpc.espd daemon. # /bin/chmod -x /usr/etc/rpc.espd 3) Restart inetd to kill any vulnerable running daemons. # /etc/killall -HUP inetd 4) Return to previous level. # exit - --- Solution --- The ESP security issue has been fixed in ESP 2.0 for IRIX 6.5.9 and above,\nand in patch 4123 for IRIX 6.5.7 and 6.5.8.
