  "Workarounds": "An excerpt from 20010501-01-P which includes a workaround: - --- Temporary Solution --- Although patches are available for this issue, it is realized that\nthere may be situations where installing the patches immediately may\nnot be possible. The steps below can be used to disable the rpc.espd daemon to prevent \nexploitation of this vulnerability until patches can be installed. 1) Become the root user on the system. % /bin/su -\n                Password: 2) Change the permissions on the rpc.espd daemon. # /bin/chmod -x /usr/etc/rpc.espd 3) Restart inetd to kill any vulnerable running daemons. # /etc/killall -HUP inetd 4) Return to previous level. # exit"
