  "Description": "CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2015-8268 According to the researcher, \"The linux based uptime.agent version 7.5 provides the ability to remotely read any file on the remote system that the uptime.agent has read access to, without authentication.\" Idera has identified that versions 7.5 and 7.6 are affected. Related vulnerabilities were initially reported in VU#377260.",

  "IDNumber": "204232",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote user may be able to read arbitrary files from a system running the Up.time agent for Linux.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Check configuration According to Idera, affected users may also use the following configuration settings to mitigate these issues: 1. All agents run in a read only mode by default, where they can only poll metrics. 2. In order to use custom scripts or trigger recovery actions, you need to set a password on the agent, or add commands to the .uptmpasswd file for the linux agent. 3. Agents communication can be encrypted with SSL by using various SSL Tunneling/Proxy Utilities (openSSL, etc). KB articles cover the specifics for implementing with Stunnel on various platforms. 4. Agents running under xinet.d can also be secured at the service level by restricting incoming connections to only accept connections from the Monitoring Station, or limit the total number of connections, etc. 5. Disable Agent Commands you don't use either via the Agent Console or editing conf/agent_commands.txt."
