  "Description": "There is serious security problem with automatically cleaning\nup directories e.g. via a cron-job.\n\"cron\" is _not_ responsible for the problem but a race-condition\nin the method usally used to clean up directories is. This\nrace-condition originates in the seperation of the\ncleaning-method into two steps:\n\n- one process determines which files are to be deleted\n(depending on their age, name or size) and passes the\nfilename to\n\n- another process that actually deletes the files\n\nThe small delay between the activity of both processes can be\nused to replace the directory the file to be deleted lives in\nwith a symbolic link to an arbitrary directory in the system.\n\nMany people did not notice that is has nothing to do with\nLinux or the directory \"/tmp\" in the first place. A short\nspot-check in a few institutes of our university showed me\nthat there was no common sensitizing and sysadmins of other\nplatforms (e.g. IBMs AIX) are totally unaware of the problem.\n\nThe security hole is plattform independent and affects all sites\nthat automatically clean up directories like \"/tmp\", \"/scratch\"\nor \"/home\" (deleting core-files) with a cron-job that runs as\nroot.",
