  "Description": "IBM Lotus Domino includes an IMAP server. This server contains a stack buffer overflow in the handling of mailbox names. By specifying a large mailbox name, an attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. Because IMAP commands that refer to a mailbox name are used after authentication, this vulnerability appears to only be exploitable by authenticated attackers. We have confirmed that this vulnerability affects Domino server 9.0.1FP8 and earlier versions. This exploit has been referred to by the \"EMPHASISMINE\" code name. Public exploit code uses the EXAMINE IMAP command, but other IMAP commands that refer to mailbox names may also be used. Note that on Windows at least one library used by Domino does not opt in to using ASLR, which makes exploitation trivial even on modern Windows platforms. This vulnerability is also exploitable when Domino is running on other platforms, such as Linux.",
