  "Workarounds": "Do not allow WordPad to parse embedded files Microsoft WordPad is the default application for opening and interacting with RTF files in Microsoft Windows. Preventing WordPad from parsing embedded OLE objects in RTF files may mitigate this vulnerability. See the workarounds section of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-013 for instructions on how to edit the Windows registry to prevent WordPad from parsing these objects. Do not run Windows with administrator privileges Running Windows using an unprivileged regular user account may mitigate the affects of this vulnerability. See the Microsoft Technet article Applying the Principle of Least Privilege to User Accounts on Windows XP for more information."
