  "Workarounds": "[<h4>Workarounds</h4>] RealNetworks has posted the following response to this issue: http://www.service.real.com/help/faq/security/rootexploit082203.html In summary, sites running vulnerable RealNetworks media servers should consider removing one of the following View Source plug-ins from the appropriate Plugins sub-directory: vsrcplin.so (vsrcplin.so.6.0 or vsrcplin.so.9.0) on UNIX platforms, vsrc3260.dll on Windows systems. Note the media server process must be restarted in order for this change to take affect. According to RealNetworks, this change will only disable the Content Browsing feature when implemented. Affected sites could also block relevant RTSP service ports, which may include, but is not limited to, the following: rtsp                    554/tcp                         # Real Time Stream Control Protocol\nrtsp                    554/udp                         # Real Time Stream Control Protocol\narcp                    7070/tcp                        # ARCP [legacy RealServer port]\narcp                    7070/udp                        # ARCP [legacy RealServer port]\nrtsp-alt                8554/tcp                        # RTSP Alternate (see port 554)\nrtsp-alt                8554/udp                        # RTSP Alternate (see port 554)"
