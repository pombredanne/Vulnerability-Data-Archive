  "ID": "VU#362332",
  "Revision": 7,
  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "Wind River Systems, Inc.",
  "VendorInformation": "Within the VxWorks Kernel programmers guide it states: \u201cFor production systems, you will want to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation, and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. You will likely want to remove components required for host development support, such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE_WDB and INCLUDE_DEBUG), as well as to remove any other operating system components not required to support your application. Other considerations may include reducing the memory requirements of the system, speeding up boot time, and security issues.\u201d",
