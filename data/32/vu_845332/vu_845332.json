  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-2912 The Studio web interface to OrientDB contains a CSRF vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. The version of Studio bundled with OrientDB Community Edition version 2.0.3 has been reported as vulnerable. Other versions prior to version 2.0.15 and 2.1.1 may also be vulnerable. CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2015-2913 OrientDB prior to version 2.1.0 utilizes the Java library java.util.Random for Session IDs. However, this class is not random enough for security-related use. An attacker may be able to use this value to determine the internal state of the random number generator and predict future values. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-2918 OrientDB Studio web management interface does not by default enforce the same-origin policy in X-Frame-Options response headers. An attacker can conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web page.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update OrientDB has released versions 2.0.15 and 2.1.1 to address CVE-2015-2912 and CVE-2015-2913. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. The update addresses CVE-2015-2912 by disabling JSONP by default. Consider your threat model, mitigations, and needs before re-enabling this functionality. CVE-2015-2913 is addressed by using java.security.SecureRandom to generate random numbers. Set HTTP additional X-Frame-Options header Setting the additional X-Frame-Options header prevents clickjacking attacks (CVE-2015-2918). To enable this, use the following command line argument when starting the server: -Dnetwork.http.additionalResponseHeaders=\"X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY\" or add this value to the server's orientdb-server-config.xml file. Alternately, you may consider the following workarounds:",
