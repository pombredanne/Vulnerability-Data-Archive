  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can pass multiple occurrences of a sensitive environment variable (such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD, etc.) to a setuid root program. Even if glibc forces that program to ignore these variables, they may be passed along to a program called from the setuid root program. Using this indirect execution, an attacker might cause malicious code to be executed as root.",
  "Keywords": [
    "glibc",
    "unsetenv"
  ],
  "Overview": "The glibc implementation of unsetenv() fails to properly remove one of two successive occurrences of the same environment variable if the variable is redundently passed to a program.",
