  "IDNumber": "623332",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of a program calling krb5_recvauth(). This includes the kpropd program which typically runs on slave Key Distribution Center (KDC) hosts, potentially leading to compromise of an entire Kerberos realm. For more information please see the MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2005-003.",
  "Keywords": [
    "MIT Kerberos 5",

  "Overview": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause krb5_recvauth() function to free a block of memory twice, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
