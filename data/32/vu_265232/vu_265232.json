  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to access a specially crafted MIDI or HTML file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the victim. The attacker could also cause a denial of service in any application that uses the vulnerable library.",

  "Overview": "A Microsoft Windows DirectX library, quartz.dll, does not properly validate the number of tracks value in Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or crash any application using the library, causing a denial of service.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch or upgrade\nApply the appropriate patch as referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-030. The updated library (quartz.dll) is included in DirectX 9.0b and Service Pack 4 for Windows 2000. eEye notes that Windows Server 2003 is not vulnerable.",

  "Workarounds": "Modify IE settings It is possible to significantly limit the ability of IE to automatically load MIDI files from HTML documents by making all of the following modifications: Disable Active scripting\nDisable Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins (stops <EMBED src=x.mid>)\nDisable Play sounds in web pages (stops <BGSOUND src=x.mid>)\nDisable Play videos in web pages (stops <IMG dynsrc=x.mid>)\nThe only complete solution for these vulnerabilities is to apply the patch. For example, Outlook Express 6 SP1 will play a MIDI file in an HTML email message regardless of the settings for audio and video in web pages. There may be other methods to automatically load a MIDI file from an HTML document. Also, these modifications will prevent some web pages from functioning properly."
