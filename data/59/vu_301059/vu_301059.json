  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access to the Listener Control Utility Restrict access to Oracle Listeners to trusted users, hosts, and networks. Use firewall or router access control lists (ACLs) to restrict connections to the port(s) used by Oracle Listeners, 1521/tcp by default. Enable the Oracle Net feature called \"TCP valid node checking\" by modifying $ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/SQLNET.ORA ($ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/PROTOCOL.ORA in Oracle8i and prior releases) as follows: tcp.validnode_checking = YES\ntcp.invited_nodes = {list of IP addresses}\ntcp.excluded_nodes = {list of IP addresses}\nConfigure Oracle listeners with encrypted passwords. Set more restrictive file permissions on Listener configuration files ($ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/LISTENER.ORA for the default Listener). Disable the runtime modification of Oracle listener parameters by modifying $ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/LISTENER.ORA as follows: ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_listener_name=on\nNote that these workarounds are designed to limit access; they may not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability."
