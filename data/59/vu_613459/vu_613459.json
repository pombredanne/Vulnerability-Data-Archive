  "ID": "VU#613459",
  "IDNumber": "613459",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service. It could also permit an intruder to execute arbitrary code on the target Squid server with the privileges of the Squid process, usually super-user/root. Note that exploiting this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code is not yet confirmed.",

  "Overview": "There is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Squid proxy/cache server. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an intruder gaining a shell on the target Squid server.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Configure the Squid server to drop super-user/root privilege by specifying the chroot option used in squid.conf. If this is done, the attacker will only be able to execute arbitrary code as the user specified in the configuration file."
