  "ID": "VU#458659",
  "IDNumber": "458659",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Attackers able to successfully predict the query id of DNS requests initiated by client systems would be able to corrupt DNS responses and potentially misdirect network traffic and mislead victims. This could result in identity masquerading, loss of confidential information, denial of service, and other impacts typically associated with DNS cache corruption (cache pollution) or domain name information spoofing.",

  ],
  "Overview": "Systems running Microsoft Windows 98, NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP DNS resolvers accept DNS replies from any IP address, not just the ones being sent DNS requests. This may lead to domain information spoofing or DNS cache poisoning.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Use cryptographic protection of either the site DNS or network traffic (i.e., use  DNSSEC or IPSEC). Note use of DNSSEC may not be feasible by sites with older resolvers unable to validate DNSSEC-secured domain name information."
