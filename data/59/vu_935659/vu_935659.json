  "Description": "CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING: A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the Cogent DataHub application because it lacks server-side validation of query string parameter values. Attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities require that a user visit a specially crafted URL, which injects client-side scripts into the server\u2019s HTTP response to the client. HTTP HEADER INJECTION VULNERABILITY: An HTTP header injection vulnerability (also known as carriage return line feed) exists in the Cogent DataHub application as the product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.
