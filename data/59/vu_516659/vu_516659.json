  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor. Once the intruder has gained access to the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor, he could inspect or change the configuration of the device, effectively allowing complete control of the device. Since the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor is able to modify permanent and switched virtual circuits, the attacker may be able to re-route or disrupt network traffic as well as gather information about network topology.",
