  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds were suggested by David Litchfield and have not been tested by CERT/CC. Edit the httpd.conf file found in the $ORACLE_HOME$/apache/apache/conf directory. To prevent access to the globals.jsa file add the following entry: <Files ~ \"^\\globals.jsa\"> Order allow,deny\n    Deny from all\n</Files> To prevent access to the .java pages add the following entry: <Location /_pages> Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n</Location> Note that if the JSP pages are stored in a aliased directory (i.e. not a subdirectory of \"htdocs\") then it is neccessary to add an entry of <Location /dirname/_pages> Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n</Location> when \"dirname\" is the name of the aliased directory."
