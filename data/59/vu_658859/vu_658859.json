  "ID": "VU#658859",
  "IDNumber": "658859",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may cause a Juniper router to repeatedly reboot when multiple IPv6 packets are processed by the JUNOS of a vulnerable system. This would create a denial of service for the router.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Overview": "The Juniper JUNOS Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE)  leaks memory when certain IPv6 packets are submitted for processing. If an attacker submits multiple packets to a vulnerable router running IPv6-enabled  PFE, the router can be repeatedly rebooted, essentially creating a denial of service for the router.",
