  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Block AIM Authentication at the Firewall Blocking connections to login.oscar.aol.com on port 5190/tcp may prevent users on the local network from authenticating to the AIM server. This may be sufficient to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. Block Untrusted Messages AIM permits the user to only accept messages from known peers. By enabling this feature, you may be able to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. Note that you may still be vulnerable to attacks that originate from known peers if the vulnerability is exploited in a worm-like fashion."
