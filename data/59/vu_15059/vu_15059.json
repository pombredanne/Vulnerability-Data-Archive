  "Description": "Raw disk IO through the IOCTL requires only group read access to\nwrite to the device.\n\nIf you break operator on SunOS and have read on a raw SCSI device,\nyou can use the IOCTL descriptor to do raw disk IO regardless of\nthe file permission on the device.  {...} has successfully used\nthis method to format a disk, and write to specific sectors.\n\nOn NeXT systems, there is a generic SCSI device (sg).  Using the\nabove vulnerability on an sg device will give you write access to\n*any* SCSI device attached to the system.",
