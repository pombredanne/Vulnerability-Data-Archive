  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2015-7547 According to a Google security blog post: \"The glibc DNS client side resolver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when the getaddrinfo() library function is used. Software using this function may be exploited with attacker-controlled domain names, attacker-controlled DNS servers, or through a man-in-the-middle attack.\" According to glibc developers, the vulnerable code was initially added in May 2008 as part of the development for glibc 2.9. All versions from 2.9 (originally released November 2008) to 2.22 appear to be affected. More details and analysis are available in the patch announcement from glibc developers.",
  "ID": "VU#457759",
  "IDNumber": "457759",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The getaddrinfo() function allows a buffer overflow condition in which arbitrary code may be executed. The impact may vary depending on if the use case is local or remote.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update A patch for glibc is available. Affected users should apply the patch as soon as possible. The patch will also be included as part of the upcoming glibc 2.23 release. The Vendor Status information below provides more information on updates.",
  "Revision": 52,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "Some embedded operating systems or older, no longer supported versions of linux distributions may contain an older version of glibc that is vulnerable. Please check with your vendor to find out if you need to upgrade to a newer operating system in order to address this issue.",
