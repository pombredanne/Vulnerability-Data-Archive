  "IDNumber": "105259",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By making many connection requests to Oracle without connecting to the new threads created to handle the connections, an attacker can force the server to consume all memory with listening threads. Once all server memory is consumed, the next console login attempt will crash the server.",

    "DoS",
    "denial of service",
    "redirect request",

    "consume all memory"
  ],
  "Overview": "Oracle Database Server may consume all available memory and crash if clients do not connect completely in the expected manner.",
