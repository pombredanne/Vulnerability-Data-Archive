  "VendorStatement": "Information security and assurance is our highest priority in developing tactical radios and networking products for military and government customers. We have carefully reviewed the IOActive report and spoken with all relevant parties, including the authors of the report, industry partners and government technical representatives. Based upon our reviews and lengthy discussions, we are confident that both customer data and integrity of the terminal are secure in a typical use scenario and when customary physical security protocols are followed. 1. Physical access to the RF-7800B terminal is required under the scenarios defined in the report. 2. We are confident that it is not possible to gain access to the BGAN SATCOM terminal over a wireless satellite link. 3. User data is further-protected by inline network encryption with a manpack radio for information assurance."
