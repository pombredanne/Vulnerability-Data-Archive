  "Description": "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2013-6034 Firmware developed by Hughes Network Systems and used in numerous broadband satellite terminals contain hardcoded login credentials. Most of these devices are utilized for broadband connectivity through the Inmarsat satellite telecommunications network. CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2013-6035 Additionally, these devices accept unauthenticated connections on TCP port 1827 from the local ethernet port. This port utilizes an insecure proprietary protocol which can be used to perform privileged operations on the device, such as reading and writing arbitrary memory. An unauthenticated local attacker could leverage this protocol to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices. The satellite terminals from the following vendors use the affected firmware, however specific implementations may vary the exploitability of these vulnerabilities. Harris Corporation: BGAN RF-7800B-VU204\nBGAN RF-7800B-DU204 Hughes Network Systems: 9502\n9201\n9450 Thuraya Telecommunications Company: IP Japan Radio Corp., Ltd.: JUE-250\nJUE-500 CERT/CC has confirmed that the affected firmware is developed by Hughes Network Systems. GateHouse produces a BGAN network stack that is licensed to Hughes Network Systems, but the GateHouse software does not provide either of the vulnerable features. Please see the \"Vendor Information\" below for more details. The CVSS score reflects CVE-2013-6035.",

  "Overview": "Firmware developed by Hughes Network Systems used in a number of BGAN satellite terminals contains undocumented hardcoded login credentials (CWE-798). Additionally, the firmware contains an insecure proprietary communications protocol, likely a debugging service, that allows unauthenticated local network users to perform privileged operations on the device (CWE-306).",
