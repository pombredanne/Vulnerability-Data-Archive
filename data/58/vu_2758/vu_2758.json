  "Description": "On some OpenBoot-compatible Sun systems, there is a prom that can\ncontain a password; if the password is set, the system will prompt for\nthe password during the boot process. If the correct password is not\ngiven, the system will not boot. The password can be set from the\n'eeprom' utility.\n\nThe password can be set by anyone who has root access; the user is not\nprompted for an old password in order to change the password. This\nmeans that if an intruder can gain root access, he can set or reset the eeprom\npassword. If the machine then crashes, or is rebooted, it will require\nthe eeprom password (known only to the intruder) to be entered in\norder to complete the boot process. Thus, the machine is rendered\ninoperable until the eeprom is physically modified in some way. ",

  "Impact": "once user gains root to a system, they can arbitrarily change\nthe eeprom passwd (it doesn't prompt for the old passwd). This\nrenders the machine effectively useless until a hardware replacement\ncan be installed.",
