  "Description": "By sending a sequence of two carefully constructed packets, an intruder can cause vulnerable systems to crash or hang. According to the reporter, the problem can be triggered when a TCP packet is sent that \n\n1) has options in the IP header that exceed 20 bytes\n2) is fragmented\n3) the first fragment is stored in an mbuf cluster\n\n After processing, the options for the packet end up in non-contiguous buffers. One of the routines that works on the packet assumes that the option information is stored in contiguous buffers. ",
