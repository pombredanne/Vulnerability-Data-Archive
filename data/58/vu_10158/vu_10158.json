  "Description": "The Excite Web Server is a freely available, unsupported web search\nengine provided by excite.com.\n\nIt accepts a number of parameters from a site specific web form.\nAmong these parameters is a query string ($query) which is used in\nsearching data.\n\nThe data passed to the query string by the user is not sufficiently\nsanitised to remove meta-characaters.  This means that an attacker\nwho enters a query string with a command separator (eg., a\nsemicolon on a UNIX web server, or a ^Z on an NT server) can\nexecute any command on that server as the web server process user\nid.",
