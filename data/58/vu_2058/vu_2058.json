  "Workarounds": "rm config file - suggested by vendor.... see [#18427]\n\"     A workaround (although not a good workaround) is to\ndelete your ccmail.cfg file. This will force ccMail\nfor Windows v2.0 to create a new ccmail.cfg file the\nnext time you start ccMail. The new file will not\nallow you to view the user password. We will be fixing this problem ASAP. At this time, I\ndon't have a date for when the fix will be available."
