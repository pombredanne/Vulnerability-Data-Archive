  "Description": "ht://dig is a set of tools to allow a webmaster to index and search a variety of pages. One of the functions it supports is the automatic notification by email when a page changes. To accomplish the notification, the page-owner embeds a special tag in his web page of the form <meta name=\"htnotify-email\" content=\"...\">. The site administrator run htnotify to notify people when \"watched\" pages have changed. The problem is that htnotify does nothing to check the input it receives via the tag. By constructing appropriate input, the intruder can cause htnofity to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the account running htnotify. ",

  "Impact": "This vulnerability is somewhere between local-user-gets-root and remote-user-gets-root. Anyone on the local \"site,\" where site means the set of pages indexed by ht://dig, can gain access to the account that runs htnotify. This is a larger set of users that just people with accounts on the local machine, but it is a smaller set, obvioulsy, than the whole world.",
