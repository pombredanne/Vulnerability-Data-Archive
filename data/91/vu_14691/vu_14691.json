  "Description": "There is a possible buffer overflow in new version of ncftp (2.4.3,\nreleased few days ago) - it uses 512-bytes long buffer to store local\nworking directory. You may exploit it creating eg. /TEST directory\non ftp server with subdirectory eg. xxx(200)xxx/yyy(200)yyy/zzz(200)zzz.\nIt's sufficient to crash ncftp when directory is being retreived using\n'get -R /TEST'.",
