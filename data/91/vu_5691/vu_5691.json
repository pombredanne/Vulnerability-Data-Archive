  "Description": "A security hole in all versions of Samba has been recently\ndiscovered. The security hole allows unauthorized remote users to\nobtain root access on the Samba server.\n\nAn exploit for this security hole has been posted to the internet so\nsystem administrators should assume that this hole is being actively\nexploited.\n\nThe exploit for the security hole is very architecture specific and\nhas been only demonstrated to work for Samba servers running on Intel\nbased platforms. The exploit posted to the internet is specific to\nIntel Linux servers. It would be very difficult to produce an exploit\nfor other architectures but it may be possible.\n\n[new release available]\n\nThis release also adds a routine which logs a message if anyone\nattempts to take advantage of the security hole. The message (in the\nSamba log files) will look like this:\n\nERROR: Invalid password length 999\nyour machine may be under attack by a user exploiting an old bug\nAttack was from <IP address>\n\nwhere <IP address> is the IP address of the machine performing the\nattack.",
