  "IDNumber": "610291",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An intruder can interrupt the ordinary operation of a vulnerable IIS server or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of ASP ISAPI extension, ASP.DLL. On IIS 4.0, ASP.DLL runs as part of the operating system thus allowing an intruder to take full administrative control. On IIS 5.0, ASP.DLL runs with the privileges of the IWAM_computername account.",

  "Workarounds": "Until a patch can be applied, you may wish to disable the ASP ISAPI extension by using the IIS Lockdown tool, available at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/locktool.asp. In addition, you can use the URLScan tool to block URLs that contain non-ASCII data. This may be useful in limiting the damage an intruder could do through this vulnerability."
