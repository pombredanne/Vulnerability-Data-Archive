  "Description": "Handy Backup appears to be vulnerable to remote authorization bypasses, allowing an attacker to view backup files even if permissions are not set, as well as a permanent denial of service that prevents the backup client from running. Both issues were already disclosed publicly at Hack in Paris 2014 by the security researchers. Note that the information on Handy Backup appears starting at time stamp 31:46 in the linked video. The CERT/CC is currently unaware if current versions of Handy Backup are vulnerable; Novosoft was contacted but has been unresponsive.",
