  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the system. Exploitation of a server will cause the code to be executed with the privileges of the application or service exploited via this vulnerability. For exploited clients, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system with the privileges of the current user.",
  "Keywords": "OpenSSL",
  "Overview": "OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. There is a buffer overflow on 64-bit platforms related to the ASCII representation of integers.",
