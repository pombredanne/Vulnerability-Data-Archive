  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Where possible, limit access to trusted users, hosts, and networks. Use firewall or router ACLs (access control lists) to restrict connections to the port used by Oracle TNS Listeners, 1521/tcp by default. Enable the Oracle Net feature called \"TCP valid node checking\" by modifying $ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/SQLNET.ORA ($ORACLE_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/PROTOCOL.ORA in Oracle8i and prior releases) as follows: tcp.validnode_checking = YES\ntcp.invited_nodes = {list of IP addresses}\ntcp.excluded_nodes = {list of IP addresses} Note that restricting access to Oracle TNS Listeners will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability."
