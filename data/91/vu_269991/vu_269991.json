  "Description": "Note: this is a different vulnerability from VU#460687 CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\nIOActive reports that Cobham Sailor 6000 series satellite communication terminals contain hardcoded credentials to communicate via the Tbus 2 protocol. The Tbus 2 protocol is a maintenance protocol for shipboard communications. The vendor Cobham has provided the following statement: All Over-The-Air (OTA) commands require user authentication based on specific passwords to the specific terminal. No hard-coded credentials can be used in any case. User authentication is required for each individual command set so there is no possibility to exploit another user\u2019s credentials. Furthermore the security has been enhanced in mini-C software release 1.06 by requiring local action on the ship before allowing remote TBUS2 commands. Cobham SATCOM will continue to evaluate any potential vulnerabilities with its equipment and implement increased security measures if required.",

  "IDNumber": "269991",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker may be able to send arbitrary Tbus 2 commands to the terminal, affecting the operation of the system.",
