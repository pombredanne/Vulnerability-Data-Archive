  "Workarounds": "Until a patch for this issue can be applied, the following actions may reduce the chances of exploitation: Restrict access to Oracle \nOnly known and trusted users should be allowed access to Oracle. Additionally, user accounts should only be granted the fewest privileges needed to perform necessary tasks. Change login credentials for default Oracle accounts Oracle creates numerous default accounts when it is installed. Upon installation, accounts that are not needed should be disabled and the login credentials for needed accounts should be changed."
