  "VendorStatement": "Sidewinder G2 and Sidewinder 7.0 Firewall base system:  Not Vulnerable\nSidewinder G2 and the Sidewinder 7.0 Firewall base system does not have any elements which could be bypassed by this attack. Sidewinder 7.0 IPS premium feature:  Vulnerable\nBy design, the Sidewinder 7's IPS subsystem detects attempts to use this evasion technique, as well as other evasive encodings, and will either block or audit as configured. However, due to a software issue this protection can be bypassed. A software update (Sidewinder 7.0.0.02.H02) was released on 7/3/07 to correct this flaw, and is available to all customers with a current support contract. SnapGear: Vulnerable\nSnapGear products at version 3.1.5 and earlier include a vulnerable version of Snort. This will be corrected in an upcoming release."
