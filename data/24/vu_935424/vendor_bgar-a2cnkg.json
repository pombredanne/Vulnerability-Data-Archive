  "VendorStatement": "This issue affects the versions of the Linux Kernel as shipped with Red Hat \nEnterprise Linux 4, 5, 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue \nas having Low security impact. Additionally a workaround is available. A future \nupdate may address this issue. VMM layer: Deactivation of memory deduplication Deactivating memory \ndeduplication will effectively mitigate all attack vectors. This measure \nunfortunately eliminates all the highly appreciated benefits of memory \ndeduplication, namely the increase of operational cost-effectiveness through \ninter-VM memory sharing. Deactivating memory deduplication is the simplest way to prevent exploitation \nof this attack. However this will cause an increase in the amount of memory \nrequired and in some situations may adversely impact performance (e.g. due to \nslower swap space being used). It is recommended that customers test this \nworkaround before using it in production."
