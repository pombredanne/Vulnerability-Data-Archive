  "Description": "The following is from the Secure Networks draft advisory:\n\nIn order to avoid forcing users of RSA based authentication to\ngo through the trouble of retyping their pass phrase every time\nthey wish to use ssh, slogin, or scp, the ssh package includes a\nprogram called ssh-agent, which manages RSA keys for the ssh\nprogram.  The ssh-agent program creates a mode 700 directory in\n/tmp, and then creates an AF_UNIX socket in that directory.\nLater, the user runs the ssh-add program, which adds his private\nkey to the set of keys managed by the ssh-agent program.  Later,\nwhen the user wishes to access a service which permits him to\nlog in using only his RSA key, the ssh client connects to the\nAF_UNIX socket, and asks the ssh-agent program for the key.\n\nUnfortunately, when connecting to the AF_UNIX socket, the ssh\nclient is running as root, and performs insufficient permissions\nchecking.  This makes it possible for users to trick their ssh\nclients into using credentials belonging to other users.  The\nend result if any user uses RSA authentication AND uses\nssh-agent to avoid having to type his pass phrase repeatedly,\nother users with accounts can access remote accounts belonging\nto the ssh-agent user.\n\nNote that the name of the socket file is easy to guess.  Look for\nfiles named /tmp/ssh-*.  This will tell you who runs ssh.  Look at\na process listing for ssh-agent, and find the parent pid.  The name\nof an AF_UNIX socket wil be /tmp/ssh-{victim}/agent-socket-{ppid}.\n(If there are several agents running then the attacker may need to\ntry more than once.)\n\nThe attacker then simply needs to use the -l option with ssh to\ngain access to the remote machine as the victim user.",
