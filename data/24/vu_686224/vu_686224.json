  ],
  "Overview": "A vulnerability in the way OpenSSL handles invalid public keys in client certificate messages could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability requires as a precondition that an application is configured to ignore public key decoding errors, which is typically only the case during debugging.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch\nUpgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c  or 0.9.6k. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an advisory from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries.",
