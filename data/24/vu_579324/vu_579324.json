  "IDNumber": "579324",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause the router to reboot, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the router. Repeatedly rebooting the router will result in a denial-of-service situation.",

    "Cisco",

  "Workarounds": "According to the Cisco documentation: The workaround is to configure access lists to explicitly permit authorized hosts or networks to the http service. The syntax for this command for routers and switches running Cisco IOS software is: ip http access-class <access-list number> access-list <access-list number> permit host <authorized host #1>\naccess-list <access-list number> permit host <authorized host #2> access-list <access-list number> deny any The <access-list number> in the above example needs to be in the range of 1-99 or 1300-1399 (IP Standard access list range)."
