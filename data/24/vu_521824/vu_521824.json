  "Description": "According to ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-11-126-01: An independent researcher has identified eight vulnerabilities in 7-Technologies (7T) IGSS SCADA human-machine interface (HMI) application. Seven of these vulnerabilities occur in IGSSdataServer service on Port 12401/TCP. The eighth vulnerability is identified in the Data Collection application (dc.exe) on Port 12397/TCP. Both vulnerable services run as part of the IGSS application suite. The IGSS Data Server is responsible for data transmission between the IGSS server and the operator stations. All vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable and can allow denial of service, path traversal, and arbitrary code execution.",
