  "Description": "It appears the program is operating on a\nuser-provided filename as root rather than as the calling user.  If\nso, I wonder if the problem is that this program, when written, was\nnot intended to be setuid but that characteristic was added later to\nmake it easier for syadmins (or users) to run the program without\nhaving to become root first.",
