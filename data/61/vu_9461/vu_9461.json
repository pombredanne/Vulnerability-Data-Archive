  "Description": "Even is the Windows NT FTPD server has anonymous ftp disabled,\nit may be configured to permit \"guest\" users to login.\nIf in the user policies setting, \"Everyone\" is permitted access,\nthis means \"the list of users allowed to Access this computer\nfrom the network\" and includes non-existant accounts.\nThis is independent of the setting that disables anonymous FTP.\n\nThe problem is compounded because PCs do not by default have all the\nstandard permissions & restrictions of unix, where anonymous ftp\nconnects usually have little or no rights. Instead connections usually\nhave full read permissions.\n\nBecause it is a configuration problem it is actually easy to rectify\nonce you are aware of it. There are two straightforward fixes\nOption 2 allows ftp from known users and denies\nanonymous/unknown log ins, similar to normal unix systems.\n\n1. Disable the ftp service. I think this is disabled by default.\n\n2. Run the User Manager and select the menu \"Policies\" an the item\n\"User Rights\". Select the right \"Access this computer from the\nnetwork\" and remove \"Everyone\" from the list of groups granted this\nright.",
