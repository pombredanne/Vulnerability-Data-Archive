  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting Disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Microsoft has provided this and other workarounds in Microsoft Security Advisory 911302 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-054. Note that disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
