  "Workarounds": "Upgrade or patch With the Mac OS X 10.4.1 Update, Safari will prompt the user before installing a widget, thus preventing automatic widget installation. Please note that the dialog used in this prompt is somwhat misleading. The dialog asks \"Are you sure you want to download the application '<widgetname>'?\"   For example: By the time the dialog is displayed, Safari has already downloaded, extracted, and examined the contents of the widget archive. If the user clicks \"Download,\" the widget is not \"downloaded\" in the expected sense. It is installed into the user's widget directory. Disable \"Open 'safe' files after downloading\" By default, Safari will open \"safe\" files after downloading them. This includes movies, pictures, sounds, documents, disk images, and widgets. By disabling this option, Safari will not automatically install widgets. This appears to be a more effective solution than upgrading to 10.4.1 by itself. By not automatically opening files, Safari will not automatically execute other software to handle downloaded files. Other software may contain vulnerabilities, and some \"safe\" files may contain code, place content in a known location, or otherwise contribute to an attack. To disable this option, select \"Preferences\" from the Safari menu and uncheck the option \"Open 'safe' files after downloading,\" as specified in the Securing Your Web Browser document."
