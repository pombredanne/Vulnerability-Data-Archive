  "Description": "Someone with physical access to a Sparc-based system can gain access to the openboot prompt, and from there, manipulate the contents of memory. With knowledge of the process structures, an intruder can change the in-memory process to gain privileged access. \n\nIn addition to gaining root access, an intruder is also likely to be able to manipulate things like \"securelevel\" on systems that have such a variable. At the moment, I don't believe that Sun has a 'securelevel' variable, nor do I believe that BSD systems use OpenBoot",
