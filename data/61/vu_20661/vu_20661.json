  "Description": "All I need to do is make my own repository, add that user to the\n$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd file, then do whatever I want.  One easy way is\nmake/change a script that is run at commit time to stash a copy of a\nshell, setuid to the user running it, somewhere.  Say you do that as bin.\nThen you gain access to bin.  On most BSD systems and many other systems,\nyou can then modify any one of many different binaries.  That is, of\ncourse, just an example; there are many other ways to gain root at that\npoint.\n\nexcertped from original message posted to newsgroup:\nThe basic idea is this: You have CVS server with pserver installed. You\nconnect to it with your client. Starting the client, You specify the path\nof the repository on the server. Let's supposse next, that on the machine\nwith CVS server runs ftp server with annonymous access (not rare, I think)\nand with the \"incoming\" directory. Attacker first uploads passwd file\n(with root account and crypted password) to incoming directory on the\nserver and then connects to the server via CVS client specifying\nftp/incoming as a repository. The CVS daemon performs authorisation with\nuploaded passwd and attacker is \"CVS-logged in\" to the server. Now he can\nmake anything as a root on the server, what CVS can. I'm not sure if the\nCVS can be fooled to run arbitrary commands or write otside the\nrepository, but I don't like the idea anybody writing and erasing files as\na root on my system.",
