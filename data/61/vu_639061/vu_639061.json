  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The impact appears to be that a local user could replace files in the /tmp directory with symbolic links, causing a running dialog command to open an unintended file for write access. This may be sufficient for the attacker to gain the privileges of the user running the dialog command.",
