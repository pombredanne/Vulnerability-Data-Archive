  "VendorStatement": "The JBoss AS console manager should always be secured prior to deployment, as directed in the JBoss Application Server Guide and release notes. By default, the JBoss AS installer gives users the ability to password protect the console manager. If the user did not use the installer, the raw JBoss services will be in a completely unconfigured state and these steps should be performed manually: http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss"
