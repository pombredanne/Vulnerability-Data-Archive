  "ID": "VU#929656",
  "IDNumber": "929656",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by injecting a specially crafted BGP UPDATE message into a legitimate BGP session. An attacker with a configured BGP session could attack targets several BGP hops away, or an attacker could spoof TCP traffic.",

  ],
  "Overview": "BGP implementations from multiple vendors including Juniper may not properly handle specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages. These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service. Disrupting BGP communication could lead to routing instability.",

  "Workarounds": "In order to send a specially crafted BGP UPDATE message, an attacker must have or spoof a valid BGP connection. The following workarounds and other BGP security techniques may provide some defense against spoofed connections, however spoofed connections may not be a realistic threat scenario, and the more correct resolution is to upgrade. Authenticate BGP Traffic Use TCP MD5 to authenticate BGP traffic (RFC 2385). Only allow BGP traffic from authorized peers. It is generally recognized that TCP MD5 Restrict BGP Access Restrict BGP network access to authorized peers. If possible, run BGP on management networks, not transit networks. More information about BGP security (including secure BGP configuration templates) is available from the Team Cymru Reading Room."
