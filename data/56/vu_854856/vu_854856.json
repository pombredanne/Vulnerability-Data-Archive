  "Workarounds": "Disable the WMI Object Broker ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The WMI Object Broker ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID: {7F5B7F63-F06F-4331-8A26-339E03C0AE3D} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ.\u00a0"
