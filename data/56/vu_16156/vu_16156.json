  "Description": "Default Xsession contains \"xhost +\"",
  "ID": "VU#16156",
  "IDNumber": "16156",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Any user without a private .xsession file is vulnerable to X attacks. One such attack, for example, is the \"xkey\" program that has been\nwidely distributed that allows a remote user to tranparently monitor\nthe keystrokes in an open window.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "",
  "References": "SGI IRIX 4.0.5 (and probably earlier) systems include an \"xhost +\"\ncommand in the X startup scripts by default.\nThis permits remote machines to communicate to the system's\nX server which can open some security vulnerabilities.\nSites are recommended to remove this command.  This will mean\nthat local and remote clients cannot access the X server\nwhich may inhibit some functionality for local users.\nIf that is a problem, an alternative is to use the X11\n\"MAGIC_COOKIE\" feature by setting\nDisplayManager*authorize:  on\nin /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config or in individual users'\nX configuration files.  Interested sites should refer\nto their X11 documentation for details - we don't have\na document on how to do this.",
