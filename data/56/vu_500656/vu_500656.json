  "Resolution": "Disable Teredo Disabling the Teredo service will mitigate this vulnerability. To disable the Teredo service, open the windows command prompt as administrator, and enter the following commands: netsh\ninterface\nteredo\nset state disabled See the Microsoft Technet article Internet Protocol Version 6, Teredo, and Related Technologies in Windows Vista for more information on how to disable the Teredo service. Disable IPv6 Disabling IPv6 support will prevent the Teredo service from working. See the Microsoft October 2005 edition of the Cable Guy for instructions on how to disable IPv6 in Windows Vista.",
