  "Impact": "A local attacker may be able to hijack a named pipe, which may result in privilege elevation. Quoting from MS03-031, \"This could allow an attacker to gain control of the named pipe at the same permission level as the user attempting to connect. If the user connecting remotely had higher access rights than the attacker, the attacker could assume those rights when the named pipe was compromised.\"",
