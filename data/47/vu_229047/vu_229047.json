  "Description": "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2016-2346 According to the researcher, Allround Automations PL/SQL Developer version 11 periodically checks for updates over HTTP. When an update is available, PL/SQL Developer downloads the update and executes the update without verifying authenticity or performing other checks. By intercepting such requests and modifying the necessary fields, an attacker with a man-in-the-middle position between the victim and the network may be able write arbitrary data to vulnerable devices and execute arbitrary code with permissions of the PL/SQL Developer user. The researcher has published a blog post with more information.",

  "Overview": "Allround Automations PL/SQL Developer version 11 checks for updates over HTTP and does not verify updates before executing commands, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update PL/SQL Developer version 11.0.6 has been released to address this issue. The update utility now uses HTTPS and restricts downloads to the allroundautomations.com domain. Affected users may also consider the following workaround:",
