  "Description": "from  www.mirc.co.uk:\n                 \"mIRC is a shareware IRC client for Windows. It is developed and copyrighted by\n                 Khaled Mardam-Bey. mIRC is a highly configurable IRC client with all the goodies\n                 other clients on UNIX, Macintosh and even on windows offer, combined with a nice*\n                 and clean user interface. mIRC offers full color text lines, DCC File Send and Get\n                 capabilities, programmable aliases, a remote commands and events handler, place\n                 sensitive popup menu's, a great Switchbar, World Wide Web and sound support,\n                 and... a lot more. mIRC is shareware but not crippled in any way...  \"\n\n\nReports:\n\n1. mIRC (as other irc clients) can perform an action according to what\nhappened on IRC, it can execute commands, reply to IRC etc. The actions and\nresponses can be stored in script  file, which defaults to SCRIPT.INI\n\n2. mIRC (as other irc clients) can tranfser files directly, using DCC\nprotocol which is an enhancement of IRC protocol (the conection is direct,\nis only initiated via IRC protocol). mIRC can be set up to download every\nfile when someone initiates DCC send to it.\n\n3. in last few days a VIRUS appeared on Internet, named SCRIPT.INI which is\nset up to:\na) if it's active, it tries to send itself to anyone who joined channel\nwhere is mIRC with virus on. (That's why i say is is virus). If the\nperson has autogetting of sent files set to ON, the virus is loaded to\nSCRIPT.INI file in current directory, and when mIRC is again run from\nthat directory, it becomes active (mIRC is usually still run from the\nsame directory, often i's also directory where it's installed as most\nWindows programs)\nb) when predefined person (probably author if virus) joins the channel\nwhere active virus is on, virus will try to send him some system files.\n(c:\\win95\\system.cb,c:\\unix\\etc\\passwd,c:\\linux\\etc\\passwd,content of\nc:\\mirc). It also sends report to channel #x3212 (the channel is now\nprotected by IRC operators on most IRC nets).\nc) virus can respond some commands from authors and execute some actions on\nthem (i didn't study it in detail)\n\nMay be able to detect by - there is script.ini on the disk (probably in mIRC\ndirectory) has size around 2048 bytes containg these lines:\nn10=ON 1:TEXT:*:#:/msg #x3212 ^? $+ $chan $+ ^? < $+ $nick $+ > $parms\nn11=ON 1:JOIN:#:/dcc send $nick SCRIPT.INI",
