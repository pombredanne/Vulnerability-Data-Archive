  "Description": "The Microsoft Windows OLE OleAut32.dll library provides the SafeArrayRedim function that allows resizing of SAFEARRAY objects in memory. In certain circumstances, this library does not properly check sizes of arrays when an error occurs (CVE-2014-6332). The improper size allows an attacker to manipulate memory in a way that can bypass the Internet Explorer Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) sandbox as well as the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). This vulnerability can be exploited using a specially-crafted web page utilizing VBscript in Internet Explorer, however it may also impact other software that makes use of OleAut32.dll and/or VBscript. A Metasploit module exploiting this vulnerability has been released. More information is available in a blog post from IBM X-Force.",
