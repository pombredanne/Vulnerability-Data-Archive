  "Workarounds": "Per SGI Security Advisory 20020606-02-I: There is no effective workaround available for these problems. SGI recommends either disabling or uninstalling the product. To disable the product from running, perform the following steps: # killall /usr/etc/xfsmd\n  # vi /etc/inetd.conf Look for a line in inetd.conf that looks like this: sgi_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd ...and comment it out by putting a \"#\" at the beginning of the line: #sgi_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd ...or simply remove the line from the file. # killall -HUP inetd To remove the product from the system, perform the following command: # versions remove eoe.sw.xfsmserv"
