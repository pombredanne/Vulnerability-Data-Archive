  "Description": "Two serious vulnerabilities in Novell's WebAccess CGI script (GWWEB.EXE).\n\nServer tested: NT 4.0 / IIS 3.0 / WebAccess version 5.2.\n\n1. Unauthorized file read access\n\nThe CGI script GWWEB.EXE allows one to steal any file readable by IIS server\ndaemon (i.e. virtually any file) located in the same logical disk as the script\nwas installed. For example, one can retrieve the WebAccess configuration file,\nwhich contains sensitive informations about WebAccess agent, by submitting the\nfollowing URL:\n\nhttps://www.victim.com/cgi-bin/GW5/US/GWWEB.EXE?LANG=US&HTMLVER=HTML1&MIME=text/plain&GET=../../commgr.cfg\n\nThe argument following GET= can be any file located in the same logical disk as\nGWWEB.EXE, for example ../../../../boot.ini etc.\n\n2. Buffer overflow\n\nThe GWWEB.EXE CGI script seems to be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. We\nnoticed that submitting wery long argument to the same URL as above (i.e. for\nexample GET=xxxxxxxxx, x repeated more than ~250 times) crashes the script.\n\nWe believe that the argument submitted after GET= is concatenated to the\npathname prefix (for instance C:\\WEBACCESS\\cgi-bin\\GW5\\US\\HTML1\\) in a\nfixed-size buffer, probably allocated on the stack. This would let an\nexperienced attacker run commands on the target machine using widely spread NT\nbuffer overflow attack techniques.",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Note that in order to exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker doesn't need\nto be authenticated by WebAccess. 1. An attacker can read any file located in the same logical disk as the script\nwas installed, bypassing IIS access control mechanisms. 2. We believe that the second vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely\nrun commands on the server.",
