  "Impact": "Microsoft Windows may have some AutoPlay enabled, even though the Group Policy Editor and associated registry values indicate otherwise. This may allow an attacker to cause a user to inadvertently execute arbitrary code on a removable device, such as a USB drive. Certain versions of malicious code called Conficker or Downadup use the AutoRun feature to propagate.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis issue is addressed for Windows Vista and Server 2008 systems in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-038. This update corrects the behavior of NoDriveTypeAutoRun on those platforms. Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003 users should install the update in Microsoft Support Document KB967715. Please also consider the following workarounds.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable AutoRun\nWith limited testing, it appears to be possible to disable AutoRun and AutoPlay on Microsoft Windows systems by saving the following text as a .REG file and importing it into the registry: REGEDIT4\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\IniFileMapping\\Autorun.inf]\n@=\"@SYS:DoesNotExist\"\nThis registry value appears to prevent windows from parsing and taking actions based on the Autorun.inf file, which both AutoRun and AutoPlay utilize. Note that Windows can cache AutoRun capabilities of devices via the MountPoints2 registry key, though. So even after disabling AutoRun as described above, Windows may still automatically execute files on devices that Windows has listed in this cache. For this reason, we also recommend removing this cache by deleting the MountPoints2 registry key for each user: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MountPoints2\nBelow are the original workaround settings that we had published. However, disabling the MCN message may prevent Windows from properly detecting when a CD-ROM is changed. Therefore, the above workaround may be more appropriate. Set the Autorun registry value for CDs to 0. This will prevent Windows from sending a Media Change Notification (MCN) message when a CD-ROM is inserted, which will in turn prevent AutoPlay with these devices. Disable AutoPlay for all media and devices, by clearing the Use AutoPlay for all media and devices setting in the Windows Control Panel. Details for how to do this are available in the Windows Help and How-to. Do not set the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry values in HKLM or HKCU. If they are present, we recommend removing the values. This can be also be accomplished by using the Group Policy Editor to set the \"Turn off Autoplay\" option to \"Not Configured.\"\nSet the \"Default behavior for Autorun\" to Enabled - \"Do not execute any autorun commands\" in the Group Policy Editor. The relevant settings in the Group Policy editor can be reached by running gpedit.msc and going to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> AutoPlay Policies."
