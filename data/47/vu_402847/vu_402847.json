  "Description": "CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk - CVE-2016-6547\nThe Nut mobile app stores the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API in cleartext in the cache.db file. CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2016-6548\nThe Nut mobile app makes requests via HTTP instead of HTTPS. These requests contain the user's authenticated session token with the URL. An attacker can capture these requests and reuse the session token to gain full access the user's account. CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2016-6549\nThe Nut device allows unauthenticated Bluetooth pairing, which enables unauthenticated connected applications to write data to the device name attribute. The CVSS Score below represents CVE-2016-6548",
