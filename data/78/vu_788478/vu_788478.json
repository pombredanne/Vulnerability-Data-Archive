  "Description": "The advisories from American Information Security Group report the following vulnerabilities. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2012-2981\n\"An input validation flaw allows for authenticated users to execute arbitrary Perl statements, commands, or libraries by parsing any file provided.\" CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command - CVE-2012-2982\n\"An input validation flaw within /file/show.cgi allows for authenticated users to execute arbitrary system commands as a privileged user. Additionally, anyone with a previously established session can be made to execute arbitrary commands on the server by embedding the attack in HTML code\u2013such as IMG SRC tags within HTML emails.\" CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory - CVE-2012-2983\n\"A directory traversal flaw within edit_html.cgi allows an attacker to view any file as user root.\" Full details of each vulnerability are available in the American Information Security Group advisories linked in the References section.",
