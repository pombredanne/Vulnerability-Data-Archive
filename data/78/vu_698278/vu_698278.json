  "Description": "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\nRealPlayer version 16.0.3.51 and possibly earlier versions contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The .RMP file format is similar to standard XML encoding. An attacker can place malicious code in the value of the version or the encoding attributes inside the XML declaration to craft a malicious .RMP file. Once the file is opened by the victim, the program may crash or allow execution of code.",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to trick a user into opening a malicious .RMP file which may cause a denial-of-service condition or lead to arbitrary code execution.",
