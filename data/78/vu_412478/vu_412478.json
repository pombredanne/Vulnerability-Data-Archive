  "ID": "VU#412478",
  "IDNumber": "412478",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By providing specially crafted ASN.1 encoded data to a vulnerable system, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming system resources. This has only been observed on Microsoft Windows systems. One potential attack vector is a client certificate message containing specially crafted X.509 certificates. Note that OpenSSL versions 0.9.7c or 0.9.6k and above do not accept unsolicited client certificates (VU#732952).",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch\nUpgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c  or 0.9.6l. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an advisory from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries.",
