  "Overview": "The IEEE 802.11 wireless networking protocol contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service to any wireless device within range.",

  "Resolution": "A complete solution is not available for 802.11 DSSS devices. As noted by AusCERT, \"...a comprehensive solution, in the form of software or firmware upgrade, is not available for retrofit to existing devices. Fundamentally, the issue is inherent in the protocol implementation of IEEE 802.11 DSSS.\"  Sites running wireless networks should consider security and availability requirements, network design, and the workarounds listed below.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Use non-DSSS 802.11 protocols 802.11 protocols that use frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are not affected by this vulnerability. 802.11a uses OFDM, 802.11 can use FHSS, and 802.11g can use OFDM. Note that this workaround will not provide protection against management frame spoofing or RF attacks. Constrain wireless networks Depending on the application and site infrastructure, it may be possible to prevent attackers from getting in range of 802.11 networks by using physical barriers (walls, fences, elevation, etc.). In addition, different building materials provide various degrees of shielding. Do not rely on 802.11 for high availability Due to the inherent vulnerabilities in 802.11 (VU#106678, VU#391513, RF interference), do not deploy 802.11 networks for applications that require high availability (e.g. safety, critical infrastructure)."
