  "Workarounds": "Disable Active Scripting Known attack vectors for this vulnerability require Active Scripting to be enabled. By disabling Active Scripting, the chances of exploitation are reduced. For instructions on how to disable Active Script in Internet Explorer, please refer to the Internet Explorer section of the Securing Your Web Browser document. Additional workarounds are available in Microsoft Security Advisory 917077. Read and send email in plain text format An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted HTML email. Only reading email in plain text will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability through email. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. If you use Microsoft Outlook, we encourage you to apply the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
