  "Description": "Both Microsoft Windows platforms (95 & NT) can store filenames in two\nversions.  A short version, known as 8.3-compliant, is restricted to a\nfilename length of 8 characters and an extension of 3 characters.  This\nshort version is required for backward compatibility with DOS.  Windows\ncan also store filenames with long filenames.  This long version is often\neasier to read and more informative as to file content.\n\nIf a Windows filename is 8.3-compliant then it is stored as is.  However,\nif the filename is not 8.3-compliant (i.e., greater than 8 characters long),\nthen the filename is stored as the non-compliant long filename and as\n8.3-compliant, being modified in a predictable manner.\n\nExample:\nFile \"Abcdefgh.xyz\" is 8.3-compliant and would just be stored as \"Abcdefg.xyz\".\nHowever, long filename \"Abcdefghijk.xyz\" would be stored:\nas is: \"Abcdefghijk.xyz\" (long filename)\nand also as:\"Abcdef~1.xyz\" (modified)\n\nSome Windows-based Web Servers have not compensated for these dual\nfilename versions when protecting files that have long filenames\n(i.e., \"Abcdefghijk.xyz\").  They only protect the files via the long filename\nversion.  This leaves the modified 8.3-compliant filename version\n(i.e., \"Abcdef~1.xyz\") unprotected.  This means that any user can still\naccess a protected file, not by the long filename, but by the modified\n8.3-compliant filename (i.e., \"Abcdef~1.xyz\").",
