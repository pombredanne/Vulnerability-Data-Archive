  "ID": "VU#972334",
  "IDNumber": "972334",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of Administrator on vulnerable systems running Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Furthermore, successful exploitation has been reported to cause the LDAP service to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Keywords": [
    "IMail",
    "LDAP",
    "iLDAP.exe",
    "buffer overflow",
    "specially crafted LDAP message"
  ],
  "Overview": "A buffer overflow in the LDAP server component supplied with some versions of the Ipswitch IMail Server could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.",

  "Workarounds": "Filter network traffic for the LDAP service Block or restrict access to the LDAP service (389/tcp) on affected systems from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Sites, particularly those who are not able to apply the patches, are encouraged to consider implementing this workaround. Note that this change may break some desired functionality depending on particular site configuration details. As a general rule and a matter of good security practice, the CERT/CC recommends blocking access to all services that are not explicitly required."
