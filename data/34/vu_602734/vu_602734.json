  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nQuoting the Cisco Advisory: As the mitigation for the vulnerabilities is a repair script, a software upgrade is not required to address the vulnerabilities. However, if you have a service contract, and wish to upgrade to unaffected code, you may obtain upgraded software through your regular update channels once that software is available. For most customers, this means that upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's Worldwide Web site at http://www.cisco.com.",

  "Workarounds": "Apply Cisco Repair Script Cisco has provided a repair script as a workaround until an upgrade is available. The repair script is available from: http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cmva-3des Note: The URL above requires a valid Cisco Connection Online (CCO) user account. Quoting from Cisco's Advisory: Cisco's repair script adds 3 levels of improved security to the Director agent: 1. The Director agent no longer listens on TCP or UDP ports 14247 for remote connections from a Director Server. This change prevents the Denial of Service attacks described in the Impact section.[VU#721092] 2. The repair script secures the Director agent such that even if port 14247 is reenabled, the Director agent still would not accept connections from any Director Server. 3. The Director Agent executable files which are not necessary to the functioning of the program, yet provide high levels of access or control, are completely disabled by this repair script. Please note that applying this repair script may cause adverse affects on production systems. For information, please refer to the Cisco Advisory."
