  "Description": "A number of security weakness have been discovered in programs that\nperform validation based on remote IP and DNS addresses.  The\nproblems arise from software that fails to perform sufficient\nchecks on data returned from DNS or to adequately differentiate\nbetween dotted quad IP addresses and fully qualified DNS hostnames.\n\nAccording to system administrator folklore, using IP addresses is\nmore secure than DNS names since DNS is vulnerable to spoofing\nattacks.  However, for a number of programs we examined, including\nsome implementations of rlogind, it is trivial to circumvent\nvalidation schemes based on IP address.\n\nThe general problem is, that authentication using IP-addresses is\ncompletely insecure. However we have three different problems: a)\nUsing ip-spoofing to fake the source ip-addr and gain access b)\nPoison a DNS-cache and insert bogus PTR records to gain access c)\nModify your own DNS-server to return special PTR records to gain\naccess\n\nSome admins are trying to \"protect\" against problems b) and c) by\nspecifing (if possible) the ip-addresses instead of the names in\nconfiguration files.  The (not so new) problem, is that some\nsoftware does not check if a line in the configuration file is a\nip-address or a hostname. This results in matching of names on\nip-addresses and vice versa.",
