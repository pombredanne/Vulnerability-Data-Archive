  "Description": "Summary: HP has issued a security bulletin \n(https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05827409) indicating there is a \nvulnerability in the Synaptics Touchpad Driver with Potential, Local Loss of \nConfidentiality.\u00a0 This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 and HP will be \nannouncing a CVE in the future.\u00a0 HP has provided updates to address this \nvulnerability on many laptops. The revision history for the HP vulnerability report indicates it was INITIALLY \nRELEASED on 07-Nov-2017 and UPDATED on 12-Dec-2017.\u00a0 Theorizing, HP learned of \nthe vulnerability, published an initial report and they were working with the \nvendor, Synaptics, on patches. Researcher Michael Myng (aka ZwClose) found a deactivated keylogger in a piece \nof software found on over 460 HP laptop models. A full list of affected laptops \nis here. (https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/some-hp-laptops-are-hiding-a-deactivated-keyl\nogger/) Technical Details: The keylogger is deactivated by default but could represent a privacy concern \nif an attacker has physical access to the computer. https://zwclose.github.io/HP-keylogger/ Further research into: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other Vendors that write touchpad drivers 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other laptop Vendors that may use Synaptics drivers 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating a detection script or signature to identify vulnerable drivers.",
