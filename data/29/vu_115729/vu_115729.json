  "IDNumber": "115729",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to supply a maliciously crafted TGA file (.tga or .targa) could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause a denial of service. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the QuickTime user opening the malicious file. The crafted TGA image may be supplied on a webpage or in email for the victim to select, or by some other means designed to encourage them to invoke QuickTime on the exploit image..",
