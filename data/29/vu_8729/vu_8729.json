  "Description": " ICQ File transfer spoofer v.0001 - [ http://www.rootshell.com\n   by Eric Hanson (hanser@wwc.edu), Sam Fortiner (fortsa@cs.wwc.edu),\n * Hans Buchheim (buchha@cs.wwc.edu), and Richard Patchett\n * (patcri@cs.wwc.edu).\n *\n * This is our first attempt at anything icq related.  It's messy, but it\n * works.\n *\n * Known bugs:\n *   - Doesn't support speed changes (crashes)\n *   - Doesn't work quite right with the Java client\n *\n * Tested with:\n *   - Slackware Linux 2.0.30\n *   - ICQ Version 98a beta, DLL v1.07\n *\n * Copyright (c) 1998\n */\n\n\nApparently a vulnerability with a program icqrev:\n\nUpon first installation, it creates a file on Windows system dir, called\nsystem32.exe, and changes the registry to load it as an event handler at\nstartup under\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run folder.\n\nIn this reported case it allocated on the rc5des program that was running.\n\nOpens a listening socket at port 12076, apparently ftp protocol.\n\nOpens a irc connection to an undernet server, joining channel #gjamer\nwith key 3abbas\n\nA short stay on that channel showed me hundreds of backdoored computers.\n\nThis last action is the one that made me post  this, since anyone that\nknows the username/password can watch who is running the backdoor, thus\njust having to ftp using enormous list of ip's he gets and have full\naccess to the host.\n\nThe username and password are not very difficult to find through\ndebugging of the backdoor program.\n\nA short solve is to delete the created key that runs\nc:\\(WINDIR)\\system\\system32.exe on the Registry.",
