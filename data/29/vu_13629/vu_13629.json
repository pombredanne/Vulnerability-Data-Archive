  "Description": "A race condition exists in perl, in that when perl -e is executed,\nit accesses a file in /tmp with a predictable name.  If an attacker\nsuccessfully predicts the name and creates a symlink from this file\nto an arbitrary file, then the attacker, under certain conditions,\nmay be able to launch a denial of service attack.  With favorable\nconditions, an attacker may also be able to engineer this to\nprovide privileged access.\n\nFor instance, if we assume that the attacker knows that root runs a\nbatch job using perl -e, then the attacker simply has to create\nsufficient symlinks in /tmp prior to this job running.  Thus when\nthe job with euid of 0 executes, it effectively writes to and then\ndeletes the file of the attacker's choosing.",
