  "Description": "The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. Several components that support the administrative web interface supplied with the system are vulnerable to reflected (i.e., non-persistent) script injection. A malicious link supplied by the attacker (e.g., in email or another web page) can cause the vulnerable web server to reflect injected code back to the user's browser, where it is executed in the context of the affected site. The vulnerable components require the victim user to be authenticated to the affected system in order for the attacker's script to be executed.",
