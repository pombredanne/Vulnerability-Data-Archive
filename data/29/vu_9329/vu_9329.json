  "Description": "Solstice Adminsuite 2.1 is the administrative utility suite supplied with\nSolaris 2.5 server license and can be used on earlier Solaris platforms\nas well.\n\nSolstice Adminsuite 2.2 is available from Sun but since Sun ceased to\nbundle this in Solaris 2.5.1, this new version was not available to the\nauthor of this message in order to test the 2.2 suite for discovered\nvulnerability. Author would be grateful for any information concerning\nnew patches or status of vulnerability in Solstice Adminsuite 2.2.\n\nYet another 'lock'-file creation security anonomality, this time with\nsetgid bin utilities in Solstice Adminsuite 2.1.  The files in\n/opt/sparc/SUNWadm/2.1/bin are setgid bin.  They create files with\nthese bin privileges.\n\nLocal users may create symlinks in /tmp, execute the adminsuite programs and\ncreate arbitrary files with group bin privileges.  Since there are many\nimportant group writable bin system directories in Solaris 2 this can\nbe trivially used to gain root privileges.",
