  "ID": "VU#876129",
  "IDNumber": "876129",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to write malicious data to the Apache HTTP Server error logs. Once malicious data is written to the error logs, a victim using a terminal emulator to view the error logs may be subject to terminal escape sequence injection attacks.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Apache",
    "terminal escape sequences",
    "error logs"
  ],
  "Overview": "The Apache HTTP Server does not adequately filter terminal escape sequences when writing data to error logs.",
  "References": "http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vulnwatch/2003-q1/0093.html",
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",
