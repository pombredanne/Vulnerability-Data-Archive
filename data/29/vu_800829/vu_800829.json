  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to gather information about remote systems and users who connect to attackers malicious telnet server. An attacker would have to trick a victim into initiating a telnet connection using a vulnerable client. This may be accomplished with an HTML rendered email or web page, using the TELNET:// URI handler, however further user interaction may be required.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability in the handling of the NEW-ENVIRON command allows a malicious telnet server to gain information from a client's environment variables.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds\nDisable access to telnet, limit the use of telnet to trusted sites and/or encourage the use more secure remote connection clients. On Unix systems it might be viable to remove execute permission from telnet and other binaries that perform telnet. On Windows systems changing or removing the registry key entry:  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\telnet\\shell\\open\\command\nshould reduce the likelihood of successful automatic exploitation attempts such as those using telnet URLs. Note these workarounds do not address the underlying vulnerability."
