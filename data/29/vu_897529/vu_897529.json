  "IDNumber": "897529",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A malicious program could exploit this vulnerability to disclose the path to the current working directory of the Microsoft VM-enabled application. Information contained in this path could provide additional information about the system, such as the user's username, that could be leveraged in other attacks.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable Java If the ability to run Java applets is not required or desired, configure your web browser to not execute them. Information about disabling Java in various web browsers can be found here. Note that disabling Java in your web browser may not mitigate this vulnerability for Java programs that are invoked via another method."
