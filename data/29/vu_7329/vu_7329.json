Affected Supported Versions\n\n    SunOS versions 5.6, 5.6_x86, 5.5.1, 5.5.1_x86, 5.5, 5.5_x86,\n                   5.4, 5.4_x86, 5.3, 4.1.4 and 4.1.3_U1\n\n3.  Understanding the Vulnerability\n\n    The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's ECHO_REQUEST datagram to\n    elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from the specified host or network gateway.\n    A buffer overflow has been discovered in the ping program which could be\n    exploited by local users to gain root access.\n\n4.
