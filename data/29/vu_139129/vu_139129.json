  "ID": "VU#139129",
  "IDNumber": "139129",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Snort, typically root. Please note that it is not necessary for the attacker to know the IP address of the Snort device they wish to attack; merely sending malicious traffic where it can be observed by an affected Snort sensor is sufficient to exploit these vulnerabilities.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the \"stream4\" preprocessor module Sites that are unable to immediately upgrade affected Snort sensors may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by commenting out the affected preprocessor module in the \"snort.conf\" configuration file. To do this, comment out the following line: preprocessor stream4_reassemble After commenting out the affected module, send a SIGHUP signal to the affected Snort process to update the configuration. Note that disabling this module may have adverse effects on a sensor's ability to correctly process TCP packet fragments. In particular, disabling this module will prevent the Snort sensor from detecting a variety of IDS evasion attacks. Block outbound packets from Snort IDS systems You may be able limit an attacker's capabilities if the system is compromised by blocking all outbound traffic from the Snort sensor. While this workaround will not prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, it may make it more difficult for the attacker to create a useful exploit."
