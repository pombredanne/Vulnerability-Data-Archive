  "Description": "The SGI Indigo Magic System Tour package, systour, is used to\ndemonstrate the features and functionality of the Indigo Magic User\nEnvironment under IRIX 5.x and 6.x.  As part of the tour, there is an\noption to remove the tour when the user is finished.  The tour is\nremoved with the auxiliary program:\n\n/usr/lib/tour/bin/RemoveSystemTour\n\nRemoveSystemTour uses \"inst\", IRIX's software management tool, to\nremove the system tour.  As inst requires root privileges to remove\nthe tour, RemoveSystemTour is setuid root.  This allows local users\nto effectively execute inst with root privileges when removing the\ntour.  As inst is a highly configurable program, local users may be\nable to manipulate environment variables and local configuration files\nto force inst, when called from RemoveSystemTour, to execute arbitrary\ncommands with root privileges.\n\nAll sites are encouraged to check their systems for the systour package\nand, if installed, immediately apply the actions recommended in\nSection 3.  To determine if the vulnerable package is installed, use\nthe command:\n\n% versions systour",

  "Workarounds": "From the AUSCERT advisory: 3.1 Remove setuid permissions Until official vendor patches are made available, sites should\nremove the setuid root permissions from the RemoveSystemTour\nexecutable. The following command should be run as root. # chmod u-s /usr/lib/tour/bin/RemoveSystemTour\n# ls -l /usr/lib/tour/bin/RemoveSystemTour -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     sys   10024 Nov 22  1994\n/usr/lib/tour/bin/RemoveSystemTour Note that the removal of the setuid bit will prevent non-privileged\nusers removing the system tour. 3.2 Remove the package If the systour package is no longer needed, sites are encouraged to\nremove it completely from their systems. This can be done by running,\nas root, the GUI software management tool, swmgr, or the command: # versions remove systour Sites can check that the package has been removed with the command: # versions systour"
