  "Description": "We received a report that there is a security vulnerability in the\nMae-West Looking Glass product. (tracking as AUSCERT#93149)\n\n\nWe have contacted the maintainers of the Mae West Looking Glass Web\npage (digex.net), but we haven't heard back from them.\n\n\nwhilst using the mae west looking glass to check some network information,\ni accidentally issued incorrect syntax to the script that drives the page,\ni was presented with this as part of the error page generated.\n\nLine has invalid autocommand \"sh ip bgp flap-statistics invalid\"\n\nwhilst helpful, it also showed me that the commands were all being\nexecuted with \"sh\" , manipulating this a bit more.\n\nQuery: bgp flap-statistics\nAddr: `uname -a`\n\n\n\nLine has invalid autocommand \"sh ip bgp flap-statistics SunOS nitrous\n4.1.4 1 sun4m\"\n\n\nobviously, given the nature of this script demonstrated above, it would be\na trivial matter to begin playing with .rhost files and/or the password\nfor the uid for which the webserver was running.\n\nalthough via `whoami` the webserver is running as \"nobody\" this could be\nused as a stepping stone to make furthur attacks on the system or to use\nit as a place to commence denial of service attacks on another target\nwhilst reminaing relatively hidden.",
