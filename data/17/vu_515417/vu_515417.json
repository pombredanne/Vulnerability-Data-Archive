  "Workarounds": "Workarounds for administrators\nAdministrators are encouraged to periodically check their web server log files for indications (such as malformed URLs) that their web applications have been compromised. Web application firewalls and reverse proxy servers may be able to block some known attacks. Workarounds for users\nFollowing the recommendations in the Securing Your Web Browser document will mitigate many attacks that an attacker may launch after taking over a web application."
