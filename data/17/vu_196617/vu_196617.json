  "Description": "Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Several PDF viewing applications and libraries, such as poppler, are based on the Xpdf code. Xpdf contains multiple vulnerabilities related to the handling of PDF files that contain JBIG2 data. The vulnerabilities include, but are not limited to, a buffer overflow, an integer overflow, a null pointer dereference, and an infinite loop.",
