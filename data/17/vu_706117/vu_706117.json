  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access to Secure ACS Systems Use firewall/router ACLs to limit access to Secure ACS to trusted hosts and networks. Secure ACS provides the ability to restrict access based on IP addresses (see section 10-12 of the User Guide for Cisco Secure ACS for Windows Server). Ensure a trusted path Cisco also recommends ensuring that a trusted path exists between the Secure ACS Systems and the devices that interface with these systems. This will help to prevent network sniffing or packet injection along the path."
