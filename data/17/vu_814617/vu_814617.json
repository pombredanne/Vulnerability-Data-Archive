  "Resolution": "Modify sendmail Configuration\nConfigure sendmail not to accept messages addressed from and to foreign domains on behalf of unauthenticated users. IBM has released an advisory and updated configuration files for sendmail on AIX: ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/sendmail_3_mod.tar.Z\nFrom the IBM advisory: Note that this change should only be applied to systems using the default configuration files. Administrators who use customized configuration files will lose their customizations. The changes made by this modification will be lost if a migration install is done; it will be necessary to re-apply the change. This change will be made permanent in a future release of AIX.",
