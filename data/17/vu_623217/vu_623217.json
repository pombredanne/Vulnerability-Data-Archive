  "IDNumber": "623217",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A number of specific impacts can result because of this vulnerability: An attacker controlling a Kerberos version 4 shared cross-realm key can impersonate any principal in the remote realm to any service in the remote realm. This can lead to root-level compromise of a KDC, along with compromise of any hosts that rely on authentication provided by that KDC. This attack may be performed against cross-realm principals, thus allowing an attacker to hop realms and compromise any realm that transitively shares a cross-realm key with the attacker's local realm. Related, but more difficult attacks may be possible without requiring the control of a shared cross-realm key. At the very least, an attacker capable of creating arbitrary principal names in the target realm may be able to perform the attack. In conjunction with VU#442569, an attacker may impersonate any principal to a service keyed with triple-DES Kerberos version 4 keys, given the ability to capture network traffic containing tickets for the target client principal.",

  "Overview": "Several cryptographic vulnerabilities exist in the basic Kerberos Version 4 protocol that could allow an attacker to impersonate any user in a Kerberos realm and gain any privilege authorized through that Kerberos realm.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds In the absence of patching, the following workarounds have been proposed by the MIT Kerberos team: 1) V4 Cross Realm Considered Harmful Kerberos implementations should gain an option to\n    disable Kerberos 4 cross-realm authentication both in the KDC and\n    in any implementations of the krb524 protocol. This configuration\n    should be the default. 2)  Application Migration Application vendors and sites should migrate from Kerberos version 4\n    to Kerberos version 5. The OpenAFS community has introduced features\n    that allow Kerberos 5 to be used for AFS in OpenAFS 1.2.8. Patches\n    are available to add Kerberos 5 support to OpenSSH. Several other\n    implementations of the SSH protocol also support Kerberos 5. Applications such as IMAP, POP and LDAP already support Kerberos 5. 3) TGT Key Separation One motivation for the V4 triple DES support is that if a single\n    DES key  exists for the TGT principal then an attacker can  attack\n    that key both for v4 and v5 tickets. Kerberos\n    implementations should gain support for a DES TGT key that is used\n    for v4 requests but not v5 requests. 4) Remove Triple DES Kerberos 4 Support The cut and paste attack is a critical failure in MIT's attempt at\n    Kerberos 4 Triple DES. Even without cross-realm authentication,\n    this can be exploited in real-world situations. As such the\n    support for 3DES service keys  should be disabled."
