  "Workarounds": "Restrict access You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the administrative port (8004/tcp by default). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. Change the default port of the administrative interface Changing the Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine administrative interface's default port from 8004/tcp may reduce the chances of exploitation. Disable Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine user interface Once configured, disabling the Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine user interface may reduce the chances of exploitation. For information on how to disable the Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine user interface please see Symantec Security Response SYM05-017."
