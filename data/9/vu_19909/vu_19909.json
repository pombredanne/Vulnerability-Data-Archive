  "Description": "Rexd does not provide any security for requests\nbeyond disallowing requests as \"root\".  It used to be on by default\non IBM systems but that was fix in '92 by Patch U402914.\nEven so, there are two problems.  (1) If a site installs NFS,\nthe \"makenfs\" script runs sed on /etc/inetd.conf and uncomments\nany \"sunrpc_tcp\" services it finds, including rexd.\n(2) When commands are run, the user's current directory is NFS\nmounted to provide the same environment - but it does not use the\n\"no-suid\" option to mount which allows a filesystem to be mounted\nthat contains a rogue setuid root program.",

  "Impact": "If a site does not realize rexd is on, remote users can gain\nroot access. Even is rexd is turned off, an installation of NFS\nmay turn rexd back on without the administration realizing it.",
