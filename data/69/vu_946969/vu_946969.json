  "ID": "VU#946969",
  "IDNumber": "946969",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Perl programs that pass user data to routines that subsequently use that data as a format string may be vulnerable. Such routines include, but are not limited to, printf(), sprintf(), and syslog().",
  "Keywords": [
    "Perl programs",
    "user-controlled format string",
    "sprintf()",
    "printf()"
  ],
  "Overview": "Programs written in Perl may contain many of the same types of format string vulnerabilities as programs written in C.",
  "References": "http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2005-12/0066.html",
  "Resolution": "Repair Perl Program Programs written in Perl that contain format string vulnerabilities should be changed to not include user data in format strings. Taint Mode Perl provides a \"taint\" mode (-T) that may detect format strings that include user data. However, taint mode will not catch all format string vulnerabilities and, when it  does detect an error, the program will be terminated. Thus, taint mode may stop a vulnerability from allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, but such a vulnerability can still be used to terminate the program.",
