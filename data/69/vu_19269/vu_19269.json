  "Description": "The problem is that gwind, a demon that creates windows,\ncreates a device file when it creates a window. There is a program\ncalled xwcreate which communicates with gwind and causes it to\ncreate the window and the corresponding device file.\nxwcreate normally causes the device file to be created in the\n/dev/screen directory with the same name as the window which\nis created. However, if the name of the window to be created is\nan absolute pathname, the device file will be created relative to /,\nOVERWRITING ANY FILE OR SYMBOLIC LINK WITH THAT NAME. This only appears\nto work with short pathnames, but /hp-ux and /bin/ls are both short\nenough -- reporter hasn't figured out what the exact length limit is.\n\nNote that other programs besides wxcreate call gwind and one can\nlikely communicate with gwind directly.\n\nNote that destruction of the window removes the device file but does\nnot restore the original file.",
