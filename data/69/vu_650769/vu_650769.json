  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from Microsoft\nMicrosoft addresses this vulnerability with the updates listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-040. Microsoft has released a new version of Security Bulletin MS06-040 and the associated security updates. The new version corrects the problem described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 921883. Programs that request large amounts of contiguous memory running on Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition systems with the previous version of the MS06-040 update installed could crash.",

  "Workarounds": "Until a patch can be applied, the following actions may reduce the chances of exploitation: Block or Restrict Access Block access to SMB services (139/tcp, 445/tcp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Restrict anonymous access Restrict anonymous SMB access. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 246261 for information about configuring anonymous access in Windows 2000. Note this will not prevent authenticated users from exploiting this vulnerability, and may have adverse affects in mixed-mode domains. Anonymous SMB access to SAM accounts is restricted in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 by default. Other workarounds are available in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-040."
