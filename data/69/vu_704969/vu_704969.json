  "IDNumber": "704969",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "In an insecure configuration, an attacker may sniff keystrokes or inject X windows events. Often this is sufficient to gain the privileges of the user running the insecure X server.",
  "Keywords": [
    "xhosts",
    "Xauthority",
    "insecure default configuration",
    "X",

  ],
  "Overview": "Some X server products (client software for connecting to a host with Xwindows capabilities) may be configured insecurely by default.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "Use the Xauthority facility\nX windows includes support for a security mechanism involving shared secrets between the X client and the X server. This mechanism usually involves storing the shared secret in a file named \".Xauthority\" which needs to be accessible by both the client and server. In this configuration, the security of the X windows connection is equal to the file system security of the .Xauthority file. Xauthority secrets are, however, sent in plaintext, and may be sniffed by an attacker with access to the network.",

  "Workarounds": "SSH users may enable host security for 127.0.0.1 For users tunneling X windows traffic over SSH, the allowed hosts list may contain 127.0.0.1 if the user is the only person using the computer where the X server resides. Since traffic over the network is encrypted, an attacker may not sniff or alter X windows connections."
