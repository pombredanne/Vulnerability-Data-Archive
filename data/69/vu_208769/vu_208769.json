  "Workarounds": "Do not access Windows Media Metafiles from untrusted sources Attackers may host malicious Windows Media Metafiles on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. Configure Your Web Browser securely handle Windows Media Metafiles Web browsers can be configured to take specific actions for certain types of content, such as Windows Media Metafiles. Configuring your web browser to securely handle Windows Media Metafiles will not correct this vulnerability, but will reduce the chances of exploitation. Mozilla Firefox Configure Mozilla Firefox's Download Actions not to automatically open Windows Media Metafiles. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the Firefox section of Securing Your Web Browser. Microsoft Internet Explorer Setting the  Internet Zone security setting to High will prevent Windows Media Metafiles from automatically being opened by Internet Explorer. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the Internet Explorer section of Securing Your Web Browser. Additional workarounds are available in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-078."
