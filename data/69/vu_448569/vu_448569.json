  "Workarounds": "Disable file association for AOM files Disable the file association for AOM files to help prevent windows applications from using Adobe Download Manager to open AOM files. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\aom\nDo not access AOM files from untrusted sources Attackers may host malicious AOM files on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
