  "VendorStatement": "Regarding US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU# 261869, AEP Netilla currently mitigates exposure because of its secure design. By default, AEP Netilla is \u201clocked down\u201d meaning all access to and from Netilla is denied. All types of access must be explicitly granted. Thus, when a Web reverse proxy application is configured on Netilla, users cannot access the application and Netilla will not allow the connection to the application until policies that grant access are created. Details such as whether or not to allow cookies are part of the connection access policy. Because all access to and from Netilla is denied by default, any attempt to direct a user to an attacker created web page will be denied. Netilla is also protected from the other method described in the Vulnerability Note where user key strokes are trapped in a hidden frame. When that frame attempts to send out the captured data, the data is re-written to go to Netilla where Netilla's policy checking engine will drop the data. AEP recommends that Netilla customers only add access rules for known trusted sites. If customers require access to servers outside of their control AEP recommends that they only configure policy rules that grant the absolute minimal access needed and can further mitigate the risk with these application policy settings: Cookie Support = No; JavaScript Handling = Delete; Vbscript Handling = Delete; and Host Name Hiding, a system-wide configuration setting, should be left at the default option = Do Not Hide."
