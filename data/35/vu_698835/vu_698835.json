  "Workarounds": "Consider Workarounds Described in Knowledge Base Article 888534 Microsoft Knowledge Base article 888534 describes several ways to help protect a computer from attacks that may use \"drag and drop\" features in IE. Disable Drag-and-Drop or Copy and Paste Files Disabling the zone security preference \"Drag and drop or copy and paste files\" prevents drag and drop operations. Note: This preference is not honored with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems that do not have the MS04-038 update (VU#630720). Without the patch, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 will always allow drag and drop events to occur, regardless of the zone security setting. After the patch in MS04-038 is installed, the preference to disable drag and drop events is honored. However, in our testing, the \"Prompt\" option now behaves the same as \"Disable\" with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. If set to \"Prompt,\" the drag and drop events will not occur and there will be no prompt. Render Email in Plain Text Configure email client software (mail user agent [MUA]) to render email messages in plaint text. Instructions to configure Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6 are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles 307594 and 291387, respectively. HTML-formatted email messages may not appear properly. However, script will not be evaluated, thus preventing certain types of attacks. Maintain Updated Anti-virus Software Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on anti-virus software to defend against this vulnerability."
