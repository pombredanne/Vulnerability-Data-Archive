  "Description": "CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - CVE-2015-7987 Improper bounds checking in \"GetValueForIPv4Addr()\", \"GetValueForMACAddr()\", \"rfc3110_import()\", and \"CopyNSEC3ResourceRecord()\" functions may allow an attacker to read or write memory. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference - CVE-2015-7988 Improper input validation in \"handle_regservice_request()\" may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. Apple has also issued a security advisory for these issues. mDNSResponder-379.27 and later before mDNSResponder-625.41.2 are vulnerable to both issues. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-7987.",
