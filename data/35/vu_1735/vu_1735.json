  "Description": "From the comments for riptrace.c:\n\nrouted has the ability for a packet to be sent to the daemon\nthat will turn on debug mode.  The packet is able to specify the\nfile which is later opened without any checks being placed on\nthat file open.  Result: You can append to any file on the\nfilesystem.\n\nIt is believed that although the file written to is arbitrary, the\ndata written cannot be controlled by the user.",
  "ID": "VU#1735",
  "IDNumber": "1735",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Systems with vulnerable implementations of routed will allow data\nto be written to arbitrary files. In some cases this may cause\ndenial of service or unpredictable behavior. It is believed that\nthe content of the data written by the daemon cannot be controlled\nby the attacker.",
