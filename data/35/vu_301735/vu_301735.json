  "Description": "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2016-5081 According to the reporter, the Zmodo ZP-NE14-S DVR and ZP-IBH-13W cameras contain undocumented credentials for accessing the device via telnet. These credentials allow root access to the device, and are hard-coded and cannot be changed by the user. Additionally, these cameras contain an always running instance of telnet that allows network access by an attacker. Telnet cannot be disabled. CWE-636: Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open') - CVE-2016-5650 According to the reporter, the Zmodo ZP-NE14-S DVR and ZP-IBH-13W cameras can be forced to deauthenticate and connect to an unencrypted network with the same SSID, even if the device settings specify use of encryption such as WPA2, as long as the competing network has a stronger signal. An attacker must be able to set up a nearby SSID, similar to an \"Evil Twin\" attack. The CERT/CC has to-date been unable to reach the vendor to confirm these vulnerabilities.",
