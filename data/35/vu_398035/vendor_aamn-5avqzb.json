Topic:          tcpdump contains remote vulnerabilities [REISSUED] Category:       core\nModule:         tcpdump\nAnnounced:      2000-10-31\nReissued:\t2000-11-06\nCredits:\tDiscovered during internal auditing. Affects:        All releases of FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x prior to 4.2\n                FreeBSD 3.5.1-STABLE and 4.1.1-STABLE prior to the\n                correction date\nCorrected:      2000-10-04 (FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE)\n\t\t2000-10-05 (FreeBSD 3.5.1-STABLE)\nVendor status:\tPatch released\nFreeBSD only:   NO 0. Revision History v1.0  2000-10-31  Initial release\nv1.1  2000-11-06  Corrected patch I. Background tcpdump is a tool for monitoring network activity. II. Problem Description Several overflowable buffers were discovered in the version of tcpdump\nincluded in FreeBSD, during internal source code auditing. Some\nsimply allow the remote attacker to crash the local tcpdump process,\nbut there is a more serious vulnerability in the decoding of AFS ACL\npackets in the more recent version of tcpdump (tcpdump 3.5) included\nin FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE, which may allow\na remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the local system\n(usually root, since root privileges are required to run tcpdump). The former issue may be a problem for systems using tcpdump as a form\nof intrusion detection system, i.e. to monitor suspicious network\nactivity: after the attacker crashes any listening tcpdump processes\ntheir subsequent activities will not be observed. All released versions of FreeBSD prior to the correction date\nincluding 3.5.1-RELEASE, 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE\nare vulnerable to the \"remote crash\" problems, and FreeBSD\n4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE are also vulnerable to the\n\"remote execution\" vulnerability. Both problems were corrected in\n4.1.1-STABLE prior to the release of FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE. III. Impact Remote users can cause the local tcpdump process to crash, and (under\nFreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE, 4.1.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-STABLE prior\nto the correction date) may be able to cause arbitrary code to be\nexecuted as the user running tcpdump, usually root. IV. Workaround Do not use vulnerable versions of tcpdump in network environments\nwhich may contain packets from untrusted sources. V. Solution One of the following: 1) Upgrade your vulnerable FreeBSD system to 4.1.1-STABLE or\n3.5.1-STABLE after the respective correction dates. 2a) FreeBSD 3.x systems prior to the correction date Download the patch and the detached PGP signature from the following\nlocations, and verify the signature using your PGP utility. ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:61/tcpdump-3.x.patch\nftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:61/tcpdump-3.x.patch.asc # cd /usr/src/contrib/tcpdump\n# patch -p < /path/to/patch\n# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/tcpdump\n# make depend && make all install 2b) FreeBSD 4.x systems prior to the correction date NOTE: The patch distributed with the original version of this advisory\nwas incomplete and did not include all of the security fixes made to\nthe tcpdump utility. In particular, it did not address the remote code\nexecution vulnerability.
