  "Description": "When using the lynx browser, from the \"Go\" Menu, you can enter the\nfollowing URL:\n\nLYNXDOWNLOAD://Method=-1/File=;/bin/sh;/SugFile=/dev/stdin\n\nThis will give a shell on the system on which the lynx client is\nexecuting.\n\nNormally, this is a minor problem at best.\n\nHowever, lynx can also be used establish a captive account.  If\nthis is done, it is possible to telnet to the victim machine.  The\nmachine then automatically establishes a lynx session for you (with\nno authentication) connected to some web service.  If you enter the\nURL given above, you then have a shell on the victim machine,\nrunning as the id of the captive process.\n\nIt is also possible to obtain the contents of arbitrary files\n(without a shell) on the victim machine by entering URLs of a form:\n\nLYNXDOWNLOAD://Method=-1/File=/etc/passwd/SugFile=/dev/stdin\n\n\nFurther feedback from unc.edu also gave the following:\n\nWith a little experimentation the bug,\ngoto:  LYNXDOWNLOAD://Method=-1/File=;/bin/sh;/SugFile=/dev/stdin,\nstill was able to produce a root shell when lynx was started as\n\nlynx -anonymous -cfg /usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg \\\n-restrictions=dired_support,disk_save,download,editor,mail,exec,shell,\n\nbut the command\n\nlynx -anonymous -cfg /usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg -restrictions=all\n\nseems to prevent the expliotation.\n\nBTY, The bug gave root access despite having the permissions on a\nprogram that launches lynx setuid to a different user.",

  "Impact": "Local users can execute arbitrary commands and inspect arbitrary\nfiles on the victim machine. For captive accounts, this means\ninteractive access to a system that the user would not normally\nhave access to.",
