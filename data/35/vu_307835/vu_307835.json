  "Overview": "Oracle9i Application Server (iAS) provides a Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) application (package) called OWA_UTIL that provides web access to a number of stored procedures. These procedures could be used by an attacker to view the source code of PL/SQL applications, obtain credentials and access to other database servers, and run SQL queries on accessible database servers.",

  "Resolution": "Block or Restrict Access\nUnauthenticated PUBLIC access to PL/SQL procedures and applications can be restricted using the exclusion_list parameter in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. This solution is described in Oracle Security Alert #28. For more information, read the section titled Protecting the PL/SQL Procedures Granted to PUBLIC in the Oracle iAS documentation under Using the PL/SQL Gateway.",
