  "Description": "This description is from [#97.28022]\n\nMany host platforms respond to icmp address mask requests\n(ICMP_MASKREQ, type 17), even when they should not respond to those\nrequests.  This permits an attacker to learn toplogical information\nabout an internal network, and may permit an attacker to infer host\nOS information or behavior from the target network.  Most hosts\nshould not respond to queries of this type unless specifically\nconfigured to do so.  However, this behavior appears to be the\ndefault behavior in a number of systems.\n\nHosts which respond to icmp address mask requests without having\nbeen specifically configured to do so are in violation of RFC1122,\nthe host requirements RFC, which states that:\n\nA system MUST NOT send an Address Mask Reply unless it is an\nauthoritative agent for address masks.  An authoritative agent\nmay be a host or a gateway, but it MUST be explicitly configured\nas an address mask agent. ... (RFC 1122, section 3.2.2.9)",
