  "Description": "There is a worm program affecting PowerPC-based systems running MacOS known as the Autostart worm. The worm can propagate via any HFS or HFS+ disk volume. Infected disks contain an invisible file named \"DB\" of type \"APPL\", creator \"????\", and the \"invisible\" attribute set.\n\nIf the system is running QuickTime 2.0 or later with the AutoStart feature enabled the \"DB\" application is launched. At this point the name of the \"DB\" application is changed to \"Desktop Printer Spooler\" and the system is restarted. \n\nThe vulnerability here is that the AutoStart feature in QuickTime can be utilized by intruders to cause users to inadvertently execute commands.\n\nThe program is executed every time the system starts and approximatly every 30 minutes it examines mounted volumes and procedes to infect any uninfected volumes.\n\nThe worm looks for data files and overwrites portions of them with garbage.",
