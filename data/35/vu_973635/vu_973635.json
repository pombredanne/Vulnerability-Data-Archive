  "ID": "VU#973635",
  "IDNumber": "973635",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If an attacker copies the private hostkey of a server, they can configure a server with the same private key as the legitimate server. Such a server would appear valid to clients if another attack, such as DNS hijacking, was used to trick the client into connecting to the attacker's server.",

    "RQ #11775"
  ],
  "Overview": "SSH provides remote, encrypted terminal access to hosts. Some SSH servers, when running on Microsoft Windows, set insecure permissions on the file storing the private SSH server hostkey. This could allow an authenticated user to obtain the SSH hostkey and use it to impersonate the server.",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Upgrade Upgrade per vendor information. Hostkey Regeneration Regardless of how the vulnerability is addressed, the hostkey may already have been compromised. Regenerating the hostkey will address this problem, although SSH clients with the old key will emit warnings when connecting to the server after the hostkey has been regenerated.",

  "Workarounds": "Workaround Correct Permissions Manually change the permissions on the hostkey file so that only the Administrator group can read the file. The default file in which the private hostkey file is stored varies by vendor."
