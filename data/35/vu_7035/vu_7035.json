  "Description": "FROM NetBSD Security Advisory 1998-005\n\nAbstract\n- --------\n\nMany character device drivers that provide mmap access do not properly\nbounds check their arguments.  The impact of this varies widely across\neach affected driver.  Some drivers allow access to portions of physical\nor device memory or may cause the system to panic or act unreliably.\n\n\nTechnical Details\n- -----------------\n\nThe NetBSD character device d_mmap driver-provided service entry is\ncalled by the device page fault routine to check for valid access and\nreturn a machine dependant value (normally a physicaly address or a page\nframe number) used to create a virtual to physical address mapping.  One\nof the arguments to the d_mmap() routine is `int offset;' which is a\nsigned value.  Many of the device drivers which implement mmap access\ndo not properly check for negative values, each having different\nfailure modes.\n\nFor example, on NetBSD/i386 the text console drivers can be fooled\ninto allowing the console user access to physical memory from 0 to\n640KB, but on NetBSD/macppc, the console driver may allow the console\nuser access to any memory location.\n\nThe NetBSD d_mmap interface was inherited by NetBSD from 4.4BSD, and\nthere may be problems in other 4.4BSD derived operating systems.\n",
