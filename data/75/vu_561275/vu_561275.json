  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the exploited application or service.",
  "Keywords": "OpenSSL",
  "Overview": "OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in OpenSSL servers that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the system",
  "References": [
