  "Description": "The vulnerabilities being exploited include:\n\n1) Replacing a system's NIS hostmap from a remote site to\nsubvert rlogin, rsh, mountd, etc.\n\n2) Reading NIS password map files, including shadow password files,\nfrom a remote machine (without needing a local account) and\nthen cracking passwords.\n\n3) Binding NIS services for a target machine to a machine under\nthe control of an attacker.\n\nIn some implementations it is also possible for local users (who do not\nhave root access) to read shadow password files.",
