  "Description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way seemem parses command line input that could result in a program crash, or potentially in arbitrary code execution with the seemem process' privilege.",
  "ID": "VU#199275",
  "IDNumber": "199275",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. Impact\nThe overall impact of this issue is limited due to: \u2022 Exploitation requires authenticated system access with sufficient privileges to access the Linux shell. \u2022 The seemem program file permissions only allow execution by the root user. Thus a successful exploit requires pre-\u00ad\u2010existing root access to the module. \u2022 Seemem is not used as part of normal operation of an X-\u00ad\u2010series chassis.",

  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Concerned users should upgrade to XOS 9.0.5, 9.5.7, or 9.6.5 as appropriate. The seemem executable has been removed in these versions.",
