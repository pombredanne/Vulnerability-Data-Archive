  "Description": "From the man page:\n\nThe CDE program dtappgather is a setuid root program.  Its purpose\nis to present personal, system, and factory applications in an\neasy-to-access window.\n\nIt uses the environment variable DTUSERSESSION.  This variable\ncontrols the location of the end user's subdirectory where the\nApplication Manager will be rooted.  The subdirectory name includes\nboth the user's $LOGNAME and $DISPLAY in order to ensure the user's\nview of the Application Manager remains consistent across sessions.\n\nFrom the reporter:\n\nThe user environment variable DTUSERSESSION is appended to a set of\npredefined paths. But DTUSERSESSION can be a relative path and/or a\nfile. Therefore, the user can run dtappgather from the command line\nafter setting DTUSERSESSION to point to a file.  dtappgather will\nthen change the permissions on that file to be owned by the user.\n\nIf this is the password file, the user can now edit it to their\nheart's content. Bad karma for the security of the system.\n\nThe fix will be to make sure the ending point of the DTUSERSESSION\nis a directory (and DTUSERSESSION doesn't have relative path?).",
