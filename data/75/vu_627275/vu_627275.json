  "Overview": "Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000 contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple extended stored procedures. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code or commands with the privileges of the SQL Server process, potentially gaining complete control over a vulnerable system. An attacker could also manipulate databases stored on a vulnerable system.",
