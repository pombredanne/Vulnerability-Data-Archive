  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The contents of files may be disclosed to unauthenticated remote users. Target files may be CGI scripts that contain sensitive configuration information such as database access credentials. This specific vulnerability does not allow an attacker to access files located outside the root directory of the web server.",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Information Server (IIS) in which a crafted HTTP GET request may return the contents of a file on the affected server. A possible target of such a request might be a script that should only be executable (not readable) by unauthenticated remote users. The contents of such a file might contain sensitive information such as user credentials for access to a back-end database. This is a variation of the vulnerability discussed in VU#35085 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-031 and more recently in VU#28565 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-044.",

  "Resolution": "Disable .HTR script mapping if not needed, as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-004: 1. Open the Internet Services Manager\n\t2. Right-click the web server, then choose Properties, then Master Properties, then WWW Service. 3. Choose Edit, then HomeDirectory, then Configuration\n\t4. Remove the .HTR entry \nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in addition to .HTR, Microsoft also recommends removing several other so-called script mappings. Apply the appropriate vendor patch: IIS 4.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27492\nIIS 5.0:  http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=27491\nNote that these are the most recent patches as referenced in MS01-004. CERT/CC also recommends the following documents on the secure configuration of Windows NT/2000 and IIS. Windows NT Configuration Guidelines\nWindows NT Security and Configuration Resources\nIIS 4.0 Security Checklist\nSecure Internet Information Services 5 Checklist",
