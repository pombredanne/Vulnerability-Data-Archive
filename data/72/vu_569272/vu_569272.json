  "Overview": "A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in implementations of login, derived from System V. An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain the privileges of the process that invoked login, user root in the cases of  in.telnetd, or in.rlogind. We have been able to determine that several vendors are affected.",
