  "Impact": "Intruders can use Lotus Domino SMTP servers to relay mail to arbitrary third parties.",

  "Overview": "Lotus Domino includes an SMTP server. Under certain configurations, an intruder may be able to relay mail to third parties through the Domino SMTP server.",
  "References": "http://maps.vix.com/tsi/ar-what.html",
  "Resolution": "Apply an update from Lotus when it is available. Lotus is tracking this issue as SPR# MLOT4THVGP. See their vendor statement for additional information.",
  "Revision": 8,

  "ThanksAndCredit": "Our thanks to Kreigh Tomaszewski, James Kersjes, Joe McMahon and Al Wever of Alticor, Inc., and Richard Rongle of Sendmail, Inc., for reporting this problem and providing technical assistance.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Until an update is available, you can avoid this problem through several techniques. First, you can use the anti-relay facilities provided by Domino. By putting a \"*\" in the \"Deny messages from external Internet domains to be sent to the following Internet domains\" field you can prevent mail originating externally from being delivered to a third-party site. Second, a third-party mail server (such as sendmail) may be able to filter out certain types of messages. For sendmail 8.10 and later, it has been reported that editing /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file and  changing the line that reads \"Kdequote dequote\" to \"Kdequote dequote -S\" stops attempts to exploit this weakness."
