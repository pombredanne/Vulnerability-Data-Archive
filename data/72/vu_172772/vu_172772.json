  "Workarounds": "Filter SNMP traffic This vulnerability can be mitigated by filtering Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets traffic from the IP address of the NAM to an affected device. Filters can not be applied to the affected device itself to be effective, they must be applied to systems that are deployed in front of it. Apply Access Control List Users that are unable to upgrade should apply an access control list (ACL) on the vulnerable device to restrict access to trusted management systems. Details on creating and uploading an ACL can be found in Cisco's Protecting Your Core document. More details on these and additional workarounds can be found in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory."
