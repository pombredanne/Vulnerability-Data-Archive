  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable Kerberos application server or cause a denial of service.",
  "Keywords": [
    "MIT",
    "Kerberos",

    "arbitrary code execution",

  ],
  "Overview": "The krb5_rd_cred() function in the MIT Kerberos 5 library does not securely deallocate heap memory when decoding ASN.1 structures, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. A remote, authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on any system running an application that calls krb5_rd_cred(). This includes Kerberos application servers and other applications that process Kerberos authentication via the MIT Kerberos 5 library, GSSAPI, and other libraries.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Depending on network architecture and application requirements, it may be practical to restrict access to Kerberos application servers from untrusted networks such as the Internet. While this will help to limit the source of attacks, it will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses."
