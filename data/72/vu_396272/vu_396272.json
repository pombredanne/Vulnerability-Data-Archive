  "ID": "VU#396272",
  "IDNumber": "396272",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating a symbolic link named '.last_run' and pointing towards any existing file, an attacker can cause mgetty to overwrite the file. Since the attacker cannot control the content of the overwritten file, the risk of exploiting this for elevated privileges is low.",
  "Keywords": [
    "mgetty",
    "race",
    "symlink",
    "temporary",
    "tmp"
  ],
  "Overview": "mgetty, a replacement for getty designed to support modem and fax use, creates files of a predictable name in a world-writable directory without checking for the prior existence or ownership of the file. Using a symbolic link attack, an intruder might cause the overwrite of arbitrary files on the system, but the risk of elevated privileges is low.",
