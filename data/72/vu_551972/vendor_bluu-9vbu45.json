  "VendorStatement": "We have removed client_chown in the latest build (3.2-3475) as precaution, even though the impact is concluded to be very low. The client_chown tool was originally designed to ease the upgrade process of the Cloud Station client, and was included starting from build 2291. To achieve this purpose, client_chown was able to change the ownership of certain system files that belong to Cloud Station client."
