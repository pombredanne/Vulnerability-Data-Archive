  "Addendum": "HP has published HPSBUX0104-148   Sec. Vulnerability in xntpd(1M) which includes workarounds to protect users of HP systems running xntpd. An except from HPSBUX0104-148 is included here: A. Background\n      A buffer overflow has been discovered on various Unix-derived\n      operating systems in its NTP daemon. Hewlett-Packard Company\n      ships xntpd on HP-UX releases and has determined that it too,\n      is vulnerable. B. Recommended solution\n      Hewlett-Packard Company recommends that xntpd be shut down\n      on all systems not absolutely needing time-of-day synchronization\n      with Internet standard time servers. On those remaining time-sensitive systems modify the default\n      configuration file (/etc/ntp.conf) to use the \"restrict\" clause,\n      to restrict all but allow some. We provide an example of a simple configuration. Please refer\n      to the man (1M) xntpd for further configuration details. # This server syncs from server 192.255.2.3 and provides\n        # time services to client 192.27.16.30,  yet\n        # blocks all others. server 192.255.2.3 prefer\n        server 127.127.1.1 # allow this client full access\n        restrict 192.27.16.30 # allow this server full access\n        restrict 192.255.2.3 # you need both of the following for the localhost\n        restrict 127.0.0.1\n        restrict 127.127.1.1 # block everything else\n        restrict default ignore NOTE:  Patches are currently in development.",
