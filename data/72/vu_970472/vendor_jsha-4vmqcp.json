  "Addendum": "Slackware has issued the following advisory regarding this problem: http://www.slackware.com/lists/archive/viewer.php?l=slackware-security&y=2001&m=slackware-security.384116 An excerpt: The version of xntp3 that shipped with Slackware 7.1 as well as the\nversion that was in Slackware -current contains a buffer overflow bug that\ncould lead to a root compromise. Slackware 7.1 and Slackware -current\nusers are urged to upgrade to the new packages available for their\nrelease. The updated package available for Slackware 7.1 is a patched version of\nxntp3. The -current tree has been upgraded to ntp4, which also fixes the\nproblem. If you want to continue using xntp3 on -current, you can use the\nupdated package from the Slackware 7.1 tree and it will work.",
