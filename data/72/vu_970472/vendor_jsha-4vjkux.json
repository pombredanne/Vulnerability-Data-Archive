  "Addendum": "The OpenBSD ports collection does contain a vulnerable version of xntp. The following extract was taken from the GNATs bug report about this issue: http://cvs.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl/full?pr=1758 Here is an addition to the OpenBSD xntpd port that applies\n NAKAMURA Kazushi's patch. How to apply: # Add the new file: /usr/ports/sysutils/xntpd/patches/patch-ntp_control.c\n cd /usr/ports/sysutils/xntpd\n make uninstall && make clean && make && make install\n reboot # necessary because tickadj is run before system securelevel is changed Caveats: The new file /usr/ports/sysutils/xntpd/patches/patch-ntp_control.c is\n NAKAMURA Kazushi's patch -- nothing more. It comes directly from the\n FreeBSD tree. It may not be OpenBSD's preferred way of doing things,\n but it will close the hole until OpenBSD has it fixed.",
