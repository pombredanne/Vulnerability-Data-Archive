  "Addendum": "RedHat has issued an advisory regarding this issue at: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-045.html An excerpt: The Network Time Daemon (xntpd on Red Hat Linux 6.2 and earlier, ntpd on \nRed Hat Linux 7.0) does not properly check the size of a buffer used to \nhold incoming data from the network. Potentially, an attacker could gain \nroot access by exploiting this weakness. Potential damage is mitigated by the fact that the Network Time Daemon is \nnot enabled by default. If you are not using network time services, it \nmay not even be installed. As a general rule, Red Hat encourages users to \nenable only those network services they actually need.",
