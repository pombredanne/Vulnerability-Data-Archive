  "ID": "VU#970472",
  "IDNumber": "970472",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "It has been reported that a remote intruder can execute arbitrary code with the default privileges on the running daemon, typically root. While this report is still being evaluated, crashing of the NTP daemon has been confirmed.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ntp",
    "ntpd",
    "xntp",
    "xntpd",
    "ntp_control.c",
    "ctl_getitem()"
  ],
  "Overview": "There is a buffer overflow defect in the ctl_getitem() function of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon responsible for providing accurate time reports used for synchronizing the clocks on installed systems. All NTP daemons based on code maintained at the University of Delaware since NTPv2 are assumed at risk.",

  "VRDA_D1_DirectReport": "1",
  "VRDA_D1_Impact": "4",
  "VRDA_D1_Population": "4",
  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Until patches can be applied, the CERT/CC strongly urges affected sites to block ntp requests (123/{tcp,udp}) at their network perimeter or disable ntpd altogether. It is unclear at this time if using secured NTP services provides a full defense against all attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability."
