  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. Proof of concept code is publicly available.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, COM objects will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites."
