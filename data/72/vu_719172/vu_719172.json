  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as a request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
