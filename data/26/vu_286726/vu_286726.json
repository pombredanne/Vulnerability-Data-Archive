  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted image file, the attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability. Specific impacts depend on the application linked to the GD Library, but likely include the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the compromised application, or cause abnormal and abrupt program termination resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Workarounds": "Do Not Follow Unsolicited Links or Access Unsolicited Images The GD Library is commonly used in PHP applications, which may be accessible via a web page or HTML email. In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases."
