  "Description": "It has been reported that Zyxel P660 series modem/router (and possibly other models which share the same core firmware) fail to parse a high volume of SYN packets on the web management interface correctly causing the device to reboot. By default, the device runs a web management interface on port tcp/80 which is accessible remotely (LAN and WAN sides).",
  "ID": "VU#893726",
  "IDNumber": "893726",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause the device to reboot and become unavailable by sending a stream of SYN packets to the device's web management interface.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Zyxel",
    "P660",
    "denial of service"
  ],
  "Overview": "Zyxel P660 series modem/router contains a denial of service vulnerability when parsing a high volume of SYN packets on the web management interface.",
  "References": "http://www.zyxel.com/products_services/p_660h_series.shtml?t=p",
  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict Network Access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks if possible. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from connecting to the service from a blocked network location."
