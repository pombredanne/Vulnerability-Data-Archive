  "Description": "We have a number of HP RX700 xterminals here, and have discovered\nthat no matter what we set the password for the config stuff to,\nthere is a certain (rather simple) word that always lets you in.\n\nThis word works under software versions 3.00 4.02 and 5.00.  I don't\nknow about any others.  The password is \"secret\".  Running \"strings\"\non the boot file for the Xterminals will reveal this word.\n\nOnce in to the config menus one of the settings that can be changed is\nthe IP address of the Xterminal.  In our case this was changed to the\nIP address of our fileserver, bringing the network down.",

  "Workarounds": "Reporter patched her binary via: I successfully patched my boot binary using perl so that the password\nis now something that looks like a printf string. It seems to be best\nto patch it to be binary zeros so that it can't be entered from the\nkeyboard at all. Note that the specific files that I use are dependent on the hardware\nI have. Also, what I have actually done is: mv C2708A C2708A.old\nln -s C2708A.patched C2708A #!/usr/local/bin/perl open(FILE1, \"C2708A\") || die \"Can't open C2708A: $!\\n\"; open(FILE2, \">C2708A.patched\") || die \"Can't open C2708A.patched: $!\\n\"; while(<FILE1>) {\ns/secret/%15.7f/; print FILE2 ;"
