  "Impact": "Attackers can trick users into disclosing information (such as credit card numbers, personal data, or other sensitive information) intended for a legitimate web site - if the user has previously accepted a certificate in which the name recorded in the certificate does not match the DNS name of the web site to which the user is connecting.",

  "Overview": "A flaw exists in Netscape Navigator that could allow an attacker to masquerade as a legitimate web site if the attacker can compromise the validity of certain DNS information. This is different from the problem reported in CERT Advisory CA-2000-05, but it has a similar impact. This vulnerability was recently discovered by Kevin Fu of of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, independently, by Jon Guyer. If a user visits a web site in which the certificate name does not match the site name and proceeds with the connection despite the warning produced by Netscape, then subsequent connections to any sites that have the same certificate will not result in a warning message. It should be noted that neither this vulnerability, nor the one described in CERT Advisory CA-2000-05 represent a weakness or vulnerability in SSL. Rather, these problems are a result of the fundamentally insecure nature of the DNS system, combined with an over-reliance on web browsers to do \"sanity checking.\" In both cases, it is (and has been) within the power of the user to validate connections by examining certificates and verifying the certificates against their expectations. Netscape and other browsers take steps to warn users when the DNS information appears to be suspicious; the browser may not be able to do all the checks necessary to ensure that the user is connecting to the correct location. Therefore, as a general practice, the CERT/CC recommends validating certificates before any sensitive transactions.",

  "Resolution": "Check Certificates\nThe CERT/CC recommends that prior to providing any sensitive information over SSL, you check the name recorded in the certificate to be sure that it matches the name of the site to which you think you are connecting. For example, in Netscape, click on the \"padlock\" icon to engage the \"Security Info\" dialog box. Then click on the \"View Certificate\" button. A dialog box will appear, listing the certificate authority that signed the certificate and the server for which it was issued. If you do not trust the certificate authority or if the name of the server does not match the site to which you think you're connecting, be suspicious. Validate Certificates Independently\nWeb browsers come configured to trust a variety of certificate authorities. If you delete the certificates of all the certificate authorities in your browser, then whenever you encounter a new SSL certificate, you will be prompted to validate the certificate yourself. You can do this by validating the fingerprint on the certificate through an alternate means, such as the telephone. That is, the same dialog box mentioned above also lists a fingerprint for the certificate. If you wish to validate the certificate yourself, call the organization for which the certificate was issued and ask them to confirm the fingerprint on the certificate. Deleting the certificates of the certificate authorities in your browser will cause the browser to prompt you for validation whenever you encounter a new site certificate. This may be inconvenient and cumbersome, but it provides you with greater control over which certificates you accept. It is also important to note that this sort of verification is only effective if you have an independent means through which to validate the certificate. This sort of validation is called out-of-band validation. For example, calling a phone number provided on the same web page as the certificate does not provide any additional security. The CERT/CC encourages all organizations engaging in electronic commerce to train help desk or customer support personnel to answer questions about certificate fingerprints. Reject certificates that don't match the host name\nAs a specific defense against this vulnerability, we recommend not accepting certificates that don't match the host name. The most likely cause of a non-matching certificate is a configuration error on the part of the web server administrator. However, a user is unable to distinguish between a benign misconfiguration and a malicious attack. Even if the user does not intend to provide any sensitive information to a site with a non-matching certificate, answering \"OK\" to this dialog may permit an attacker to successfully carry out the exploit. Stay up-to-date with patches, workarounds, and certificate management products\nApply a patch from your vendor. See the Vendor section below for further vendor-specific information.",
