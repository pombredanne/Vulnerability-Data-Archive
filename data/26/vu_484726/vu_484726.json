  "ID": "VU#484726",
  "IDNumber": "484726",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service in an application that uses OpenSSL with Kerberos cipher suites.",
  "Keywords": [
    "OpenSSL",
    "DoS",
    "denial of service",
    "SSL/TLS",
    "Kerberos cipher suites"
