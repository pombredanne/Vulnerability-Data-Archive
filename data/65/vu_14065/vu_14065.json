  "Description": "From Marco's report:\n\nA file descriptor leakage vulnerability was discovered in the\nSolaris 'setgid sys' sysdef-utility. Descriptor for kernel virtual\nmemory, open for reading, is passed to user controlled program.\n\nThis allows unprivileged users to monitor system memory and system\nactivities, including possibility to collect unencrypted passwords,\ncrypted passwords and other memory based sensitive data from the\ncomputer.\n\nLocal unprivileged users may gain privileged access (including uid\n0) via ability to monitor protected memory areas on the system.\n\n{...}\n\nProprietary locally developed setuid/setgid analyzer revealed\nfollowing anomalities with the Solaris sysdef-utility\nexec-behaviour during normal system operation:\n\n\nMay 23 11:05:42 ee3 syslog: SGUIDana::\n[sysdef] 6689[6826], 21032[21032], 900[3]{900}:\npopen(\"ls -R -p -i -1 /kernel\", \"r\")\n\nUtility performs a vulnerable popen(), actual command executed can\nbe controlled via malicious PATH setting. Command will be executed\nwith normal privileges due a kludge in 'sh' for removing extra\nprivileges (if this is compiled XPG4 someday, this kludge is not\npresent and this directly leads to GID 3(sys) compromise.",
