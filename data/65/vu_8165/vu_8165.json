  "Description": "With the default configuration of a Checkpoint Firewall 1, a remote user can be identify a machine as being a Checkpoint Firewall 1 because the TCP ports 256, 257, and 258 are listenting for a control connection. Aparently this is not clearly documented and many people do not realize that their firewall has services listening on it. It is a streatch to call this a vulnerability. I suppose the only vulnerability here is that the control connections are not clearly documented. ",
