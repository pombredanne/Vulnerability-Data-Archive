  "Description": "cfg_getline() is a function that the Apache core and several\nApache modules use to read certain types of files from disk.\nSome examples of the type of files that read with this are\nhtaccess, htpasswd and mod_imap files.\n\nIt is possible to create a sequence of data such that a\nbuffer overflow occurs while cfg_getline is reading from\na file.  If someone has access to create any of these types\nof files on the server, this hole is generally exploitable\nto gain full access to the user Apache runs as.\n\nOn most systems, this is of little consequence since users\nalready have such access via methods such as the creation of\ntheir own CGI scripts.  If, however, the server is secured\nso that the user has no access to the server other than to\ncreate and modify files (eg. a \"ftp only\" account with no\nability to create CGI scripts) this could allow increased\naccess to the server.",
