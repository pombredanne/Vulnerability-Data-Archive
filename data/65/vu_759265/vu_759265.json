  "IDNumber": "759265",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a service to crash if they can redirect authentication requests to a malicious KDC under their control. While it is not clear if this vulnerability is exploitable to gain privileges, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a client making an authentication request to the malicious server. Since the client typically executes as root, root privileges may be gained.",
  "Keywords": "kdc_reply.c",
  "Overview": "There is a buffer overflow is the kdc_reply_cipher() function of KTH Kerberos. This buffer overflow may be exploitable to allow an attacker to gain root privileges, and can be used to deny service.",
