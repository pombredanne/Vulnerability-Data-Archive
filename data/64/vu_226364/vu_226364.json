  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause an IKEv1 implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. In addition, many of these vulnerabilities may be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable IKEv1 installation.",

  "Overview": "Numerous vulnerabilities have been reported in various Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or cause an IKEv1 implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.",
