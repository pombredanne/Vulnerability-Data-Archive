  "Impact": "By providing specially crafted data to the vulnerable ASN.1 parser, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the vulnerable library. One potential attack vector is a client certificate message containing specially crafted X.509 certificates.",
