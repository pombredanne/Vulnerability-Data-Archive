  "Workarounds": "Modify NewsDesk\n<ul>\n<li>Modify newsdesk.cgi to only allow acceptable characters in URL input that is passed to open(). This type of input validation is referred to as \"positive\" or \"whitelist\" filtering. See Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data in perlsec for more information.</li>\n<li>Enabling Perl \"taint\" checking will prevent execution of commands using the pipe character (\"|\"). See perlsec and the Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO for more information.</li>\n<li>Rewrite the vulnerable open() calls in newsdesk.cgi to be safer, possibly by using sysopen(). See perlopentut for more information.</li>\n</ul>"
