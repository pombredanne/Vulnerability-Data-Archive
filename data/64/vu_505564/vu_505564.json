  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to crash affected SecureWay Directory servers, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. It is not known at this time whether these vulnerabilities will allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. These vulnerabilities exist on the Solaris and Windows 2000 platforms but are not present under Windows NT, AIX, and AIX with SSL.",
