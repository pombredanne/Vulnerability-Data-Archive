  "Impact": "From the HP-UX security bulletins digest (HPSBUX0305-259): A problem has been reported in kermit which could allow access to account bin and group daemon privileges. Until a fix is available we recommend removing suid/sgid permissions from kermit. This will limit the functionality of kermit. Full functionality will be available only to the root user.",
