  "Workarounds": "Configure administrator password\nChanging the default password of the router may help prevent an attacker from exploiting this vulnerability after Linksys has supplied a patch. Disable remote access\nDisabling remote access may help mitigate this vulnerability. Do not open untrusted links\nAn attacker may be able to create a specially crafted URL or HTML page that exploits this vulnerability. Do not open or follow untrusted hyperlinks sent through email or instant messages. Secure your wireless network\nRestricting access to your wireless network may also mitigate this vulnerability. US-CERT Cyber Security Tip ST05-003  has instructions on how to secure your wireless network."
