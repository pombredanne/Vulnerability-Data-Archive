  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Depending on network architecture, it may be practical to restrict access to KDC servers (88/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Due to network application requirements, it may be possible, but less practical, to limit access from Kerberos clients to trusted KDC and application servers. While these workarounds will help to limit the source of attacks, they will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses."
