  "Impact": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an email attachment), an attacker may be able to execute script in the Local Machine Zone. Script that executes in the Local Machine Zone can be used to download and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may obtain full access to web content in another domain, which may reside in a different security zone. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This includes the ability to spoof or modify web content, access website information such as cookies, or retrieve data from an encrypted HTTPS connection. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see CERT Advisory CA-2000-02.",
