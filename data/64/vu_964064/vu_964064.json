  "ID": "VU#964064",
  "IDNumber": "964064",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If an attacker can change the ATA password on an ATA device, that attacker can completely lock the device, making all the data on the device inaccessible.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ATA",
    "Security Set Password",
    "locking",
    "BIOS",
    "SECURITY FREEZE LOCK",
    "denial of service"
  ],
  "Overview": "ATA interface software, including multiple system board BIOS implementations do not adequately manage the ATA hard drive security mode. An attacker may be able to manipulate this situation to completely lock a hard drive resulting in an almost unrecoverable denial-of-service condition",
