  "Description": "Source of the problem seems to be that the LocalDirector \"forgets\" its\nconfigured enable password upon being upgraded to version 1.6.x from\nan older software version. A LocalDirector without a configured enable\npassword still does prompt for a password, even though that password\nis not checked. This means that the system's administrator may not\nnotice that the password has been lost for quite some time, if ever.",

  "Impact": "This means that the system's administrator may not\nnotice that the password has been lost for quite some time, if ever. Any person who can log into an affected LocalDirector via TELNET or over its\nits console port can reconfigure or shut down the LocalDirector.",

  "Workarounds": "1. Consider postponing any scheduled software upgrades to version 1.6.3. 2. Check to make sure that enable passwords are being enforced by all\nLocalDirectors. If you find that a LocalDirector is not enforcing its\nenable password, changing the password using the \"enable password\"\nconfiguration command should reactivate the password. Remember to save\nthe new password using the \"write memory\" command. Recheck password\nenforcement after any software upgrade or downgrade. 3. Make sure that you have configured a TELNET access password for your\nLocalDirector using the \"password\" configuration command. If you're not\nsure of the secrecy of your TELNET password, consider changing it. If\nyou allow unprivileged TELNET access by users who should not have\nprivileged access, consider denying those users access temporarily by\nchanging the TELNET password. 4. If you have a dialin modem connected to your LocalDirector's console\nport, or if you have the console port connected to a network device\nthat allows remote access, either disconnect the console or protect it\nusing the authentication features of the modem or network device to\nwhich it is connected."
