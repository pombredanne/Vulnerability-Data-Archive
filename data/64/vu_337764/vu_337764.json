  "Workarounds": "If a patch can't be applied, or as a workaround until a patch can be applied, you can block ports TCP/139 and TCP/445 and UDP/139 and UDP/445 at your network perimeter. This will still leave you exposed to attacks inside your network. Additionally, you may wish to block these ports using a host-based firewall, such as Microsoft's Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) or a similar product available from a number of vendors."
