  "Description": "According to AGG's website: \"OPC Scada Viewer allows you to easily and very visually display data received via the OPC interface. Data is displayed in real time, which allows you to use the program for permanent control and monitoring in various systems.\" AGG OPC SCADA Viewer is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow caused by parsing a special configuration file that can allow arbitrary code execution. For additional information see ICSA-11-018-01.",

  "Workarounds": "Do not access configuration files from untrusted sources Attackers may host malicious configuration files on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting."
