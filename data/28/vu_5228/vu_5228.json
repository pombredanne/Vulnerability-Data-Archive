  "Description": "There is a nasty bug whereby AIX, Digital Unix, Linux and possibly some\nother systems can be brought down remotely by a suitably constructed\noversize packet. Unfortunately a bug in another well known PC operating\nsystem (Windows 95) means its easy to generate such packets.\n\n** This bug is being actively exploited on the internet against all the\n** mentioned systems. This fix should be considered essential as should\n** other equivalent vendor fixes\n\n\nWin95 user types 'ping -l 65510 host.running.linux'.\n\nThe victim machine reboots OR freezes.",
