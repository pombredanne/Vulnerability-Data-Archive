  "Description": "According to ISC: If a TCP connection is established to the server on a port which has been configured for communication with a failover peer, this can cause it to become non-responsive to all normal DHCP protocol traffic. The server will progress to a communications-interrupted state - but in addition will also cease to provide DHCP services to clients. The server must be restarted to resume normal operation. This can be used as an attack vector against servers that are configured for failover partnerships.",
  "ID": "VU#159528",
  "IDNumber": "159528",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause the server to become unresponsive to all normal DHCP protocol traffic, thereby creating a denial of service.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Overview": "The ISC DHCP server contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.",
  "References": "https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/advisories/cve-2010-3616",
  "Resolution": "Apply an update Users who obtain ISC DHCP from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. This vulnerability is addressed in ISC DHCP version 4.2.0-P2. Users of ISC DHCP from the original source distribution should upgrade to this version or later, as appropriate.
