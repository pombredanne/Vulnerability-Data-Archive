  "Impact": "An attacker with knowledge of default account information and the ability to access a vulnerable device may take administrative control of the device. Immediate impacts of this level of access include, but are not limited to, the ability to add new users or modify details of existing users, and the ability change the device's configuration. Cisco lists the following practical examples of impacts resulting from exploitation: For WLSE this means that an adversary can hide the presence of a rogue Access Point or change the Radio Frequency plan, potentially causing system-wide outages. The first action may cause long term loss of information confidentiality and integrity. The second action can yield Denial-of-Service (DOS). For HSE this may lead up to illegal re-directing of a Web site with the ultimate loss of revenue. In both cases the device itself may be used as a launching platform for further attacks. Such attacks could be directed at your organization, or towards a third party.",
