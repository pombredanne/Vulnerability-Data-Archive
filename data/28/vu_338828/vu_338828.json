  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting Disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. While it does not remove the vulnerability, it does help block known attack vectors. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the Securing Your Web Browser document. Note that disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites."
