  "Impact": "Content can be stored on the Cisco Cache Engine, provided a well-known host\nname, and clients behind that Cisco Cache Engine will only receive the Cisco\nCache Engine content for that well-known host name. This would allow an\nopportunistic content provider to populate a Cisco Cache Engine with content\nof their choosing, yet make it appear as any other host name was serving this\ncontent. The clients using this \"polluted\" cache engine would be the only\nones to see this tainted content, causing confusion and service disruption. Version 2.0.3 of the Cisco Cache Engine provides additional authentication to\nverify that the hostname provided actually belongs to the site providing the\ncontent.",
