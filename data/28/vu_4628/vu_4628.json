  "Description": "The Quake server has a feature where it allows administrators to remotely\nsend commands to the Quake console with a password. However, it is\npossible to remotely bypass authentication.\n\nIn order for this to be exploited, the attacker would have to create a\nhandcrafted udp packet with a header containing the rcon command and the\npassword \"tms\" with a source IP coming from ID Software's\nSubnet. (192.246.40)\n\nThe Quake server does not require an open connection for sending the rcon\npacket.  When this is exploited, no logs are reported of the rcon command\nbeing used.\n\nThis vulnerability is present in Quake 1, QuakeWorld, Quake 2, Quake 2\nLinux and Quake 2 Solaris, all versions.",
