  "Workarounds": "Juniper security advisory JSA10624 recommends the following workaround. Due to the likelihood of the specific packet occurring during normal activity, Juniper recommends disabling WebUI (SSL) and WebAuth (SSL) until a software fix is available. This includes disabling WebUI (SSL) and WebAuth (SSL) even on internal and protected networks. This issue is completely mitigated when WebUI (SSL) and WebAuth (SSL) is disabled. Disabling SSL WebUI (HTTPS) is part of our best practices, as mentioned in KB29016."
