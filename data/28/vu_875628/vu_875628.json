  "ID": "VU#875628",
  "IDNumber": "875628",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code and can view any operating system files that are visible to the user or group the web server runs as.",

    "Easy Message Board",
    "arbitrary command injection",

  ],
  "Resolution": "Add a check to ensure that the parameter passed to the print_msg subroutine is valid i.e. a positive integer. All code in this application requires a thorough security review as user input is not validated. Best practice in deploying publicly accessible applications is to put them into some sort of hardened environment and run them as an unprivileged user.",
