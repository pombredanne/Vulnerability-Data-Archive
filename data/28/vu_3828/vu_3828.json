  "Description": "A serious security vulnerability in sendmail\nVersion 8.8.0 has been discovered that allows remote users to\nexecute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n\nVersions prior to Version 8.8.0 do not contain this\nvulnerability.  This vulnerability is exploited by sending a carefully\ncrafted electronic mail message to the system running the vulnerable\nversion of sendmail.  This vulnerability may be exploited on systems\ndespite the presence of firewalls, firewall toolkits, and other\nboundary protective measures.",

  "Workarounds": "Upgrade to sendmail version 8.8.1. Eric Allman has released a new version of sendmail which fixes this\nvulnerability. The /etc/sendmail.cf file should be modified to remove the use of the\n'9' flag on the \"Mlocal\" and \"Mprog\" lines. For example, the\nsendmail.cf file should look similar to (depending on your system and\nconfiguration): Mlocal,         P=/usr/libexec/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qrmn, S=10/30,\nR=20/40,\nT=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,\nA=mail -d $u\nMprog,          P=/bin/sh, F=lsDFMoqeu, S=10/30, R=20/40,\nD=$z:/,\nT=X-Unix,\nA=sh -c $u This can be achieved by modifying the \".mc\" file to include the\nfollowing lines: define(`LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS', `rmn')dnl\ndefine(`LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS', `eu')dnl and then rebuilding the sendmail.cf file using m4(1). It is possible to directly edit the sendmail.cf file to resolve this\nvulnerability. However, caution must be taken to ensure that the\nsendmail.cf file is not replaced in the future with a new version\nrebuilt from configuration files that include the '9' flag. Once the configuration file has been modified, all running versions\nof sendmail should be restarted or the system rebooted for these\nchanges to take effect. Additional Measures If the ability to send electronic mail to programs (for example,\nvacation programs) is not required, this feature should be disabled. This is achieved by modifying the \"Mprog\" line in the configuration\nfile to mail to \"/bin/false\" rather than \"/bin/sh\". The following\nline in the \".mc\" file will achieve this: define(`LOCAL_SHELL_PATH', `/bin/false')dnl If mailing to programs is required, it is recommended that the sendmail\nrestricted shell, smrsh, be used at all times. This applies to all\nversions of sendmail, including vendor versions. smrsh is supplied\nwith the sendmail 8.8.1 distribution and includes documentation and\ninstallation instructions."
