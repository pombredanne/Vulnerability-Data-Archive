  "Description": "From the Invensys Wonderware website: \"InBatch is powerful software that can be used in the most complex batching processes that require a high level of flexibility.\" Wonderware InBatch runs a database lock manager (lm_tcp) service that listens (manually or automatically during the launching of \"Environment Display/Manager\") on port 9001. Foxboro I/A Series Batch includes an application with the same service. The service in both products is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when copying a string into a buffer of 150 bytes which is part of a fixed structure.",
