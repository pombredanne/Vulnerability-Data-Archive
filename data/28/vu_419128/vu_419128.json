  "Description": "CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification) IKE/IKEv2 and other UDP-based protocols can be used to amplify denial-of-service attacks. In some scenarios, an amplification of up to 900% may be obtained from IKEv2 server implementations. More details are provided in a white paper from the researcher.",
