  "IDNumber": "333628",
  "IPProtocol": "tcp",
  "Impact": "The full impact of these vulnerabilities is unclear. The most likely impact is that the heap may be corrupted leading to a denial of service. If it is possible to exploit this vulnerability in a manner that would allow the execution of arbitrary code, then an attacker may be able to so with the privileges of the user running the sshd process, usually root. The impact may be limited on systems using the privilege separation feature available in OpenSSH for some systems.",
  "Keywords": "OpenSSH",
  "Overview": "Versions of the OpenSSH server prior to 3.7.1 contain buffer management errors. While the full impact of these vulnerabilities are unclear, they may lead to memory corruption and a denial-of-service situation.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable or limit access to the ssh service For those systems that do not require ssh to be enabled, we encourage users to disable the service. If the service cannot be disabled and patches cannot be applied, we recommend using a packet filter to limit access to the vulnerable service from only trusted hosts."
