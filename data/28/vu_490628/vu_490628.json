  "Workarounds": "Microsoft recommends the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. Disable Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and Windows Small Business Server 2003 Remote Web Workplace feature. Disabling Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and Windows Small Business Server 2003 Remote Web Workplace may reduce the risk of exploitation. Block port 3389/tcp at the perimeter: Port 3389/tcp is the port used by RDP. Blocking access to this port from untrusted sources may reduce the risk of exploitation. It may also be necessary to block port 4125/tcp which is used by Windows Small Business Server 2003 for RDP connections."
