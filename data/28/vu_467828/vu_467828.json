  "Impact": "An attacker who has the ability to sniff packets as they cross the network or has access to logs on the LDAP servers can acquire the plaintext passwords of users authenticating to the Kerberos system. The attacker could subsequently use these passwords to impersonate the corresponding users and gain the privileges of that principle in the Kerberos realm.",

  "Overview": "Versions 10.2 and later of Apple's MacOS X operating system include support for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). A vulnerability in the way some of these versions of MacOS X handle authentication in certain environments could expose user's passwords in plaintext as they're transmitted across the network.",

  "Resolution": "Patches and workarounds are available for this vulnerability. Please see the vendors section of this document for more details. Sites may also wish to enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connectivity to LDAP servers in order to prevent other sensitive information that may be exchanged during the LDAP session from being passed over the network in cleartext.",
