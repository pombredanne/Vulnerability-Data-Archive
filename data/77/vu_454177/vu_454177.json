  "Overview": "[ Overview  ] LiveUpdate is a tool shipped with most Symantec products to download\n        updates from the Symantec update servers. It is included as part of\n        the Norton Antivirus Package and several other products in the Symantec \n        product line. Version 1.4 of LiveUpdate (shipped with Norton Antivirus 5.x) can be\n        used for rapid deployment of hostile code (backdoors, trojan applications, \n        viruses, worms - if unknow to the NAV pattern file) and for remote \n        penetration of systems running LiveUpdate via redirection of the initial\n        connection to a server controlled by the attacker. Version 1.6 of LiveUpdate (shipped with the latest Norton Antivirus\n        2001 package) does not allow for this type of attack, but it can be \n        prevented from downloading virus descriptions and product updates. It \n        can also be used as part of distributed denial of service attacks by \n        the same attack as described for version 1.4.",
