  "Description": "  In a \"userX@hostY:File\" reference in an rcp command,\n    if hostY is the NAME OF THE CURRENT HOST (or an alias for it)\n    AND the \"File\" parameter is RELATIVE (does not begin with \"/\"),\n    the rcp command issues an rsh request to userX@hostY\n    with the permissions of userX instead of the user invoking rcp.\n\nIf the root account is set up to allow rsh's to itself, then any user can obtain read-write access to any file on the system.",
