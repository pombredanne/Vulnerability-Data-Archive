  "Workarounds": "Choose appropriate passwords To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must know the enable password for the affected router or switch. Therefore, devices with either an easily guessable password or no password at all are particularly vulnerable. For further information on choosing appropriate passwords, please consult the CERT Security Practice, \"Configure computers for user authentication.\" Disable the HTTP management interface If it is not possible or practical to immediately patch an affected device, disable its HTTP management interface to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Restrict access to the HTTP management interface If it is not possible to disable the HTTP management interface, users should restrict outside networks from accessing it. For information on how to implement these restrictions, please consult the Cisco advisory at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ioshttpserverquery-pub.shtml"
