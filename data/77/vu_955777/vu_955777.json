  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause an DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. Exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to take control of a DNS server. Once a DNS server compromised, the attacker may be able to launch attacks on other, unaffected DNS servers.",

  "Overview": "Numerous vulnerabilities have been reported in various Domain Name System (DNS) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or cause a DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.",
