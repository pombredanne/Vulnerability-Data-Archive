  "Description": "Microsoft Office 2010 provides a set of iFilters that are used by a variety of applications to process Office documents. The Office 2010 Filter Pack is a stand-alone package that provides the iFilters. A variety of applications may use iFilters, including Microsoft Windows Search, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), SharePoint Portal Server, Exchange Server, and SQL Server. The Visio ifilter, which is provided by VISFILT.DLL, contains a memory corruption vulnerability.",
  "ID": "VU#851777",
  "IDNumber": "851777",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By causing a specially-crafted Visio document to be processed with the Visio iFilter, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the iFilter. This can happen through a number of attack vectors, including placing a Visio file in a location that is indexed by Windows Search.",
