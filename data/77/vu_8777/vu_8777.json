  "Description": "ZIP disks have a password feature that is supposed to allow users to password-protect ZIP disks. When a disk is entererd, the Zip drive reads the password from a known location on the disk, and will refuse access if the password is not entered. \n\nHowever, the ZIP drive will spin-down after a period of inactivity. After spinning-down, it fails to account for changes of disks via a manual eject (the paperclip). So, if an intruder enters a disk with a known password, and then replaces it with a (target) disk with an unknown password during the \"sleep\" period, he can access the target disk by supplying the known password from the first disk.
