  "Description": "Foxit Reader is software designed to view Portable Document Format (PDF) files. The Adobe PDF Reference supports a \"Launch action\" that \"... launches an application or opens or prints a document.\"  Foxit Reader uses the ShellExecute function to handle PDFs that use a Launch action. In some cases, Foxit Reader will not prompt the user before an application is launched with a Launch action. It is also reported that the Launch Action can be used to launch an executable that is included in the PDF document, which results in arbitrary code execution.",
