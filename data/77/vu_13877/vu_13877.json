  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from your vendor In June 1998, CORE-SDI released code to detect and block attacks exploiting this vulnerability. This code was subsequently incorporated into several SSH implementations, but it contained a flaw that introduced a remote integer overflow. For vendor-specific information regarding this vulnerability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. For more information regarding the vulnerability introduced by previous attempts to patch this vulnerability, please see VU#945216.",
