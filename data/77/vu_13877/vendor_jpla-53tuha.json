  "Addendum": "This vulnerability first addressed by incorporating code written by CORE-SDI to detect and block CRC32 attacks. However, an implementation error in this code caused the vulnerability described in VU#945216, which was ultimately addressed in Secure Shell 1.2.32, available at ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh/ SSH Communications has released a public statment regarding VU#945216; for more information, please visit http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/advisories/ssh1_crc-32.cfm It is important to note that versions 2.x and 3.x of SSH Secure Shell do not serve as replacements for the SSH1 protocol. Rather, they rely upon an existing installation of Secure Shell 1.x to handle SSH1 connections. Thus, installing a version 2.x or 3.x server does not obviate the need to maintain installations of Secure Shell 1.x.",
