  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-017. This update provides a newer version of MSOWC.DLL, sets the kill bit for the vulnerable versions of the Microsoft Office Spreadsheet control, and sets the phoenix bit to retain compatibility with web pages that refer to the old CLSID for the Spreadsheet control.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable the Microsoft Office Spreadsheet ActiveX control in Internet Explorer The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {0002E510-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} {0002E511-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{0002E510-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{0002E511-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nDisable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0"
