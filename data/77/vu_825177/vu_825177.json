  "ID": "VU#825177",
  "IDNumber": "825177",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Intruders may be able to remotely execute code on the vulnerable system. Since Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Millenium Edition do not provide any separation of user privileges, exploitation of this vulnerability results in a root compromise of the affected system.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Apache",
    "arbitrary code execution",
    "POST request",
    "MS-DOS device name"
  ],
  "Overview": "Due to a flaw in the Apache web server's handling of MS-DOS device names, an attacker may be able to remotely execute code on systems running the Apache web server under some versions of Microsoft Windows.",
  "References": "http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-017.asp",
  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from the vendor The Apache Software Foundation has released version 2.0.44 of the Apache HTTP server to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software. Furthermore, users of the Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 Second Edition operating systems are encouraged to apply the patches referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-017 in order to prevent other applications from exploiting this vulnerability.",
