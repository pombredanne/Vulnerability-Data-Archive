  "VendorStatement": "Remediation in C5 EVM version 2.8.1 and above No change in the 2.8.n release. While it is preferable that the initialization vector be randomly selected for each encrypted session, the selection of a new encryption key to obscure data patterns in successive sessions is a minimal risk. This risk is not applicable in future 3.n.n releases."
