  "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition since a malicious program or applet may list other, legitimate programs or applets to the \"banned\" list in the Standard Security Manager. A malicious Java program that was designed to exploit this vulnerability could be hosted on an attacker's web page or introduced via HTML email. Any applications that depended on the now-banned Java modules from operating properly would be adversely affected. These conditions would persist for the lifetime of that instance of the VM-enabled application. Subsequent instances, or other instances held in parallel, would not be affected.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable Java - if the ability to run Java applets is not required or desired, configure your web browser to not execute them. Information about disabling Java in various web browsers can be found here. Note that disabling Java in your web browser may not mitigate this vulnerability for Java programs that are invoked via another method."
