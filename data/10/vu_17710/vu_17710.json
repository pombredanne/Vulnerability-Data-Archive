  "Description": " The exploit involves sending ane-mail message that contains embedded javascript code. \nWhen a Hotmail user views the message, the javascript code forces the user to re-login\nto Hotmail. In doing so, the victim's username and password is sent to\nthe malicious user by e-mail. (see\nhttp://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/default.htm for demo)\n \n Once a malicious user knows the password to the victim's Hotmail\naccount, he can assume full control of the account, including the\nability to:\n \n          - delete, send, and read the victim's e-mail\n          - check mail on other mail servers that the victim has\nconfigured for mail-checking\n          - access the victim's address book\n          - discover other passwords sent as confirmation of\nregistration in old e-mails\n          - change the password of the Hotmail account\n \nThe security problem is dangerously easy to take advantage of. A\nwould-be hacker needs only to embed the javascript code into the body of\nan e-mail message using a standard e-mail program such as Netscape Mail\n(free). In a working demonstration and full description of this exploit\nat http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/default.htm, it is shown that\neven users without their own internet service provider (ISP) can steal\nan arbitrary number of Hotmail passwords by using a free Geocities\naccount.\n \nThe \"Hot\"mail exploit is a serious security concern for the following\nreasons:\n \n        1.The malicious code runs as soon as e-mail message is viewed\n        2.The resources required to launch the attack are minnimal and\nfreely available.\n        3.The malicious e-mail can be sent from virtually anywhere,\nincluding libraries,\n          internet cafes, or classroom terminals\n 4.The exploit will work with any javascript-enabled browser,\nincluding the Microsoft\n          Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator.\n \n Both Microsoft and Hotmail have been notified that a security problem\nexists. The following information about the \"Hot\"Mail exploit is being\nmade publicly available to speed the process of fixing the security hole\nand inform users  how they can protect themselves. This information is\nalso being released in the belief that when the public is aware of\nserious security problems, expedient measures are taken by software\nmanufacturers to solve those problems.",

  "Impact": "In this case:  When a Hotmailuser views the message, the javascript code forces the user to re-login to Hotmail. In doing so, the victim's username and password is sent to\nthe malicious user by e-mail. So, if you run a javascript browser enabled, may be hoodwinked into providing sensitive information in response to a dialog box, for example, without realizing that it is not a real dialog box.",
