  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object present on an affected device. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices. Normally, you could mitigate against this vulnerability by restricting network access to the SNMP service. However, there is a vulnerability in the packet filtering feature of the Firewall/VPN and Gateway Security appliances that could allow an attacker to send packets to this service by specifying a source port of 53/udp (VU#329230).",
