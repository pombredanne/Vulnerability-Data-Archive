  "Workarounds": "Remove previous patch Back out patch 112908-12 (SPARC platform) or 115168-03 (x86 platform). Disable debug feature of pam_krb5 Search for any matching lines using the following command, and remove the \"debug\" entry from that line in the \"/etc/pam.conf\" (see pam.conf(4)) file: $ egrep -e '[\\\\t ]*[^#].*pam_krb5.*debug' /etc/pam.conf Disable logging of LOG_DEBUG level messages This can be accomplished by the following steps: 1. Remove or comment out entries in the \"etc/syslog.conf\" (see syslog.conf(4)) file that match output from the following command: $ egrep -e '\\*.debug|daemon.debug' /etc/syslog.conf 2. Send a SIGHUP to syslogd: $ pkill -HUP syslog"
