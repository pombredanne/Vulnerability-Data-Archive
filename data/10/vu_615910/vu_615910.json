  "Description": "CWE-284: Improper Access Control - CVE-2013-6955 Synology DiskStation Manager versions 4.3-3776-3 and below allow a remote unauthenticated user to append arbitrary data to files on the system under root privileges. According to Synology: Synology File Station in DSM employs a technique called \"Slice Upload\" to upload files when the file size is over 4GB [in the] Firefox browser. Since this feature is implemented in DSM4.0, all versions of DSM after DSM4.0 are subject to this vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to /webman/imageSelector.cgi containing the header fields X-TYPE-NAME: SLICEUPLOAD and X-TMP-FILE with the valid path of the file to append malicious code or data.",
