  "Impact": "If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted TIFF image, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application linked to LibTIFF.",
  "Keywords": [
    "SuSE LibTIFF",
    "TIFF",
    "heap-based buffer overflow OJPEG",

  "Workarounds": "Disable OJPEG support Until an update can be applied, you may wish to disable OJPEG support. To do this, the LibTIFF libraries will have to be recompiled with OJPEG support disabled. Do Not Accept TIFF Images from Untrusted Sources Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted TIFF image. By only accessing TIFF images from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced."
