  "ID": "VU#534710",
  "IDNumber": "534710",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page), an attacker could evaluate script in a different security domain than the one containing the attacker's document. The attacker could read or modify data in other web sites (read cookies/content, modify/create content, etc.). If the script is evaluated with chrome privileges, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system. VU#648758 describes one way to execute script with chrome privileges. However, due to recent changes made to the addons.mozilla.org and update.mozilla.org sites, the current proof-of-concept code that utilizes VU#648758 no longer functions properly.",
