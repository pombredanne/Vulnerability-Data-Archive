  "Description": "I'm writing to report a security hole in majordomo, version 1.94.1\n(and probably many earlier versions).  Specifically it is in the\nwrapper.c program used to obtain \"majordomo privilege\" by all of the\nvarious shell scripts.  Given how small this program is, you wouldn't\nthink it has a hole, but it does.  I noticed it just because I always\nscan any setuid root program I have to install, and given the fact\nthat it is so small, I could look at it closely.",

  "Impact": "Local user can gain access of \"wrapper\" which is setuid, in at least\nsome cases to root.",
