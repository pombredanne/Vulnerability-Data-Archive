  "Workarounds": "Workaround #1 (from WRQ): Change the server configuration using the GUI as follows: Add the string 'administrator' (without the quotation marks) to the Deny login for users in User Restrictions. Create a subconfiguration entry in the Advanced screen by adding a  UserSpecificConfig line to the end of the file, for example: \"UserSpecificConfig  New-Admin-Name  admin.config\"\nClick the Apply button to notify the running server of the changes. Create a file named admin.config in the folder where the server was installed (usually C:\\Program Files\\F-Secure\\ssh server) that contains the following line: UserConfigDirectory \"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\administrator\\\\.ssh2\" Note: The doubled back slashes ( \\\\ )are required. Both the sshd2_config and admin.config files should have their file protections changed to permit only the Administrator group to access to these files. Workaround #2 (from WRQ): Create a folder in the \"Documents and Settings\" folder with the renamed user name (such as, New-Admin-Name) and create an .ssh2 folder there (for example, C:\\Documents and Settings\\New-Admin-Name\\.ssh2. Then move - do not copy - all public key files and the authorization file to this new folder. Remember to set the file protections on these folders to permit only the New-Admin-Name user access to these files."
