  "Workarounds": "Workarounds\n<p>Microsoft recommends the following workarounds for users who are\nunable to apply the patches: <ul> <li> <b> Do not use the \"Outlook Today\" folder home page in Outlook 2002</b> You can help protect against this vulnerability by turning off the\n\"Outlook today\" folder home page in Outlook 2002. <ol> <li> In the \"Folder List\" window of Outlook, right-click on \"Outlook Today\" or \"Mailbox - [User Name]\"</li> <li> Select Properties for \"Outlook Today\" or \"Mailbox - [User Name]\"</li> <li> Select \"Home Page\" tab</li> <li> Uncheck \"Show home page by default for this folder\"</li> <li> Repeat for all other \"Folder List\" items labeled \"Outlook Today\" or \"Mailbox - [User Name]\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>Impact of Workaround:</b>\n<p>\nThe \"Outlook Today\" folder home page would no longer be available. </li> <li> <b> If you are using Outlook 2002 or Outlook Express 6.0 SP1 or later,\nread e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself\nfrom the HTML e-mail attack vector</b> <p> Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Service Pack 1 or later\nand Outlook Express 6.0 users who have applied Service Pack 1 or later\ncan enable a feature that will enable them to view all\nnon-digitally-signed e-mail messages or non-encrypted e-mail messages\nin plain text only. <p> Digitally-signed e-mail messages and encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. <p> See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=307594\">307594</a> for information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002. <p> See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=291387\">291387</a> for information about how to enable this setting in Outlook Express 6.0\n<p>\n<b>Impact of Workaround:</b> E-mail that is viewed in plain text format cannot contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally: <ul> <li> The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages. <li> Pictures become attachments to avoid loss of message content.</li> <li> Because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the mail store.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"
