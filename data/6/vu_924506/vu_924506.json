  "Description": "CWE-200: Information Exposure - CVE-2014-4876\nThe Toshiba 4690 operating system, version 6 (Release 3) and possibly earlier versions, contains an information disclosure vulnerability. Sending a special string to TCP port 54138 causes system environment variables and other information to be returned to an unauthenticated client. The vendor has stated that this disclosure occurs by design as part of the support capabilities of 4690 and that: The data being returned contains information about the current state of the 4690 OS and can be used for problem determination. The information is generally the same as that available by local 4690 APIs or from RMA, the 4690 OS system management function. It doesn't contain sensitive (PCI) information.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable services The vendor has suggested a workaround for users concerned about the information being exposed: The user should disable the ADXSITCF logical name to the string -q. This will disable the services that connect with the network to provide this information, however it will also disable RMA system management data collection as well as prevent the use of ADXSITQL by support teams for gathering information without dumping the machine."
