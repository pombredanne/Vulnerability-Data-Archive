  "VendorStatement": "Vulnerability ID: VU#301788 Vulnerability #2 Vulnerability Name: Toshiba 4690 Operating System \u2013 4690 OS System \nEnvironmental Variables Accessible. Overview The vulnerability report stated that a string written to port 54138 \"causes \nsystem environmental variables and other information to be returned to the \nattacker without authentication\". This is by design and is part of the support \ncapabilities of 4690. Description The data being returned contains information about the current state of the \n4690 OS and can be used for problem determination. The information is generally \nthe same as that available by local 4690 APIs or from RMA, the 4690 OS system \nmanagement function. It doesn't contain sensitive (PCI) information. The fact \nthat a string is used is a relic of a prior design of the tool that used the \nsame port as the unix finger service. However at this point the string is used \nsimply as a handshake. Impact Anyone on the same network could send this byte sequence receive the same data. The ADXSITQL can send additional commands to the machine to receive other data \nas well, such as directory listings or enhanced mode log files. File transfer \nof other files in either direction is not allowed. We don't consider directory \nlistings and other environmental information to be sensitive data. There is no \nsensitive data places in these log files that can be collected via this \nmechanism. Solution The user should disable the ADXSITCF logical name to the string -q. This will \ndisable the services that connect with the network to provide this information, \nhowever it will also disable RMA system management data collection as well as \nprevent the use of ADXSITQL by support teams for gathering information without \ndumping the machine. Please submit a support request to Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions if you \nhave questions.
