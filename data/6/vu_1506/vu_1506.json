  "Description": "skey/skey_crypt.c verifies if the user entered the correct S/Key or\n(when permitted) UNIX password. It contains the following fragment:\n\nif (pwd != 0 && skeylookup(&skey, pwd->pw_name) == 0\n&& skeyverify(&skey, pp) == 0) {\n\nskeylookup() opens the s/key password file; when the user is not\nregistered, skeyverify() will not be called, and the s/key password\nfile will remain open.",
  "ID": "VU#1506",
  "IDNumber": "1506",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "an unprivileged process may\nhave an open read/write file descriptor to the file /etc/skeykeys.\nIn other words, the s/key password file can be tampered with, and\nthat is about as bad as interactive root access.",
