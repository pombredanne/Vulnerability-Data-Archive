  "ID": "VU#989406",
  "IDNumber": "989406",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By sending a specially crafted OSPF packet to an affected device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause the device to reload. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to know several parameters. These parameters include the OSPF area number, netmask, hello, and dead timers, which are configured on the affected device.",

  "Overview": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS). This vulnerability may allow remote attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks on an affected device.",

  "Workarounds": "Use OSPF authentication Cisco recommends using OSPF authentication to mitigate against this vulnerability. Quoting from Cisco's Advisory, OSPF authentication may be used as a workaround. OSPF packets without a valid key will not be processed. MD5 authentication is highly recommended, due to inherent weaknesses in plain text authentication. With plain text authentication, the authentication key will be sent unencrypted over the network, which can allow an attacker on a local network segment to capture the key by sniffing packets. For more information on OSPF authentication, please see http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/104/25.shtml. Restrict access Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block or restrict access to affected devices from untrusted networks. For information on implementing ACLs, please see Cisco's white paper \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\"."
