  "IDNumber": "215006",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "If a remote attacker can convince a user to access a specially crafted ace archive, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. In addition, this vulnerability may prevent security software, such as anti-virus software, from detecting a malicious ace archive.",
  "Keywords": [
    "unace",
    "buffer overflow",
    "ACE archives",
    "unacev2.dll"

  "Resolution": "Apply patches from your vendor \nThe unace compression library is freely available and used by many vendors in a wide variety of applications. As a result, any one of these applications may contain this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable and what action to take.",
