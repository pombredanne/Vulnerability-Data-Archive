  "Workarounds": "Do not follow unsolicited links or access unsolicited images The maliciously-crafted images may be accessible via a web page link or a link sent in email. In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases. Use least privilege Operate with the least privilege possible. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation, but it may limit the impact of an attack."
