  "ID": "VU#403307",
  "IDNumber": "403307",

  "Impact": "An attacker who is able to obtain the userid and password from a URL or an HTML file may be able to gain access to the back-end database.",
  "Keywords": [

  "Workarounds": "If you must access databases with security requirement, you should employ as many of the following techniques as possible: Protect the databases with passwords\nUse the ASP capabilities of Seagate Crystal Reports (SCR)\nRestrict the database server so that it can only be accessed by the web server\nRestrict access to the web page\nUse Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to secure HTML files in transit from network eavesdroppers Even in the presence of all these precautions, you may not be safe from all variations of this vulnerability."
