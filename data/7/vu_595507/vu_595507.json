  "Workarounds": "Disable Vulnerable Service Until a patch can be applied, you may wish to consider disabling the ToolTalk service. As a general practice, CERT/CC recommends disabling any services not explicitly required. Block or Restrict Access Your router or firewall may be able to block access to the ToolTalk service at your network perimeter. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to the ToolTalk service."
