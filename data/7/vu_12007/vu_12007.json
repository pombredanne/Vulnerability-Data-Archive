  "Description": "If fsck fails during system boot, a privileged shell is run\non the system console. This behavior can represent a security\nvulnerability if users, who would normally not have root access,\nhave physical access to the console at boot time.  An attacker\ncan force the failure to occur so this is not a rare threat.",
  "ID": "VU#12007",
  "IDNumber": "12007",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "This vulnerability allows anyone with physical access to the\nsystem console to gain root access.",
