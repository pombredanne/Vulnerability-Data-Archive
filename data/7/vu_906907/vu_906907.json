  "Resolution": "Upgrade\nPer the FireFTP Developer Information page, this issue is addressed in the 0.97.2 and .99preview  releases. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a fixed version. Users who have Firefox set to Automatically check for updates and Automatically download and install the update for Add-ons should be updated to a fixed version of FireFTP automatically.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access\nFTP proxy servers and IPS systems that include support for the FTP protocol may be able to block filenames that contain directory traversal sequences. Note that this workaround may not block all attack vectors. Since Firefox extensions usually run in the context of Firefox, host-based firewalls may not be able to detect the installation or presence of Firefox Add-ons such as FireFTP."
