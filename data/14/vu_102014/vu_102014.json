  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a TCP sender to transmit packets faster than it would in the course of a normal connection. The victim could potentially exhaust its network bandwidth, thereby resulting in a denial of service. In an attack involving multiple victims, the aggregate volume of generated traffic may cause congestion or a bandwidth exhaustion denial of service to intermediate transit network providers as well.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Connection Throttling\nNetwork administrators should consider implementing per-connection throttling or other forms of traffic shaping for services on their network that could be exploited. While this workaround does not remove the underlying vulnerability, it forces an attacker to use more hosts in order to have the same overall impact. TCP Implementation Changes\nSherwood et al. proposes several implementation changes to mitigate this vulnerability. In particular, the authors suggest a strategy of randomly dropping segments on the sender. By doing this, receivers that ACK packets that are intentionally dropped by the sender can reliably be identified as misbehaving. The authors have provided a patch that implements this workaround for Linux 2.4.24 kernel. It is important to note that these implementation changes have not been ratified by relevant standards bodies such as the IETF. Implementors and administrators should exercise careful consideration and be especially aware of unintended side effects when choosing to implement these implementation changes."
