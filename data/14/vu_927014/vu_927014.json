  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to invoke local programs on the vulnerable system. This could allow the attacker to exploit a separate vulnerability in the external program being invoked or execute malicious programs that were stored on the system by another means. The specific impact of such exploitation would be dependent on the nature of the vulnerability being exploited or the malicious program being invoked.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds Disable the shell: protocol handler Mozilla and Firefox users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patches supplied by the Mozilla Project, are encouraged to consider disabling the shell: protocol handler. This can be accomplished by adding the following line to the prefs.js file: user_pref(\"network.protocol-handler.external.shell\", false); or by following these steps: Open the browser, type about:config into the location bar, and hit enter. Right click on any value inside the window and select New -> Boolean. A dialog box titled \"New boolean value\" should appear. Enter \"network.protocol-handler.external.shell\" (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. A dialog box titled \"Enter boolean value\" should appear. Enter \"false\" into this box and hit enter."
