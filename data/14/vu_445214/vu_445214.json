  "Workarounds": "Block or restrict access As a temporary measure, it is possible to limit the scope of this vulnerability by blocking access to ports used to initiate a connection with a remote WINS server at the network perimeter. These are typically ports 42/tcp and 137/udp. Please note that this workaround does not protect vulnerable WINS servers from internal attacks. Disable vulnerable service Disable WINS until a patch can be applied. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required."
