  "ID": "VU#722414",
  "IDNumber": "722414",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application that uses the vulnerable function. The scope of the impact depends on how the affected application works. Applications that process filename input from the network, such as some web applications, would be vulnerable to a remote attacker. Applications that only process filename input from a local user would only be vulnerable to a local attacker.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Perl",
    "buffer overflow",
    "win32_stat"

  "Overview": "A flaw in a standard function in some Perl distributions could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.",
  "References": "http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=93&type=vulnerabilities",
  "Resolution": "Apply a patch Patches have been developed to address this issue. For more information, see: <http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22466> (for the 5.9.x branch) <http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22552> (for the 5.8.x branch) Note that these patches require the user to recompile the Perl interpreter for their system after application.",
