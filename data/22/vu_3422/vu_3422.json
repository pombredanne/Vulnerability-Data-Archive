  "Description": "Unknown.  DEC (Rich Boren) declined to give details\nsaying they were \"required by law\" to keep the information\nconfidential unless they had received it from us.\n\nDEC's Security MUP-02 fixes a number of problems, some security\nrelated and some not.  Almost all of the security related problems\nwere previously fixed in various advisory, patches, etc. over time.\nThe few security fixes new to this are \"obscure\" and did not come\nfrom an active intrusion or from the cracker community says\nRich Boren.  He says this is \"not a high-risk or high-threat issue\".\nIt is \"mandantory\" becuase it includes so many remedial fixes\nand has been tested as a package.",
