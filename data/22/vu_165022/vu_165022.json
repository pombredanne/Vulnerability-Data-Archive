  "Impact": "By convincing a victim to click on a link in an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could create or append to arbitrary files on a vulnerable system within the security context of the user running IE. These files could contain code that could be executed through other means. The user may click the file inadvertently, or the file may be placed in a sensitive location, such as the Windows Startup folder. Please note that this vulnerability is being actively exploited.",

  "Resolution": "Install an update Office XP users should install the Office XP Update October 12, 2004, which addresses this issue. This update may also be installed via Office Update. Visio 2002 users should install Visio 2002 Service Pack 2. This update may also be installed via Office Update. SharePoint Portal users should install SharePoint Portal Server 2001 Service Pack 2. Client systems should install the client components for SharePoint Portal Server 2001 SP2. Please note that because the vulnerable component is not provided by the Windows operating system, these updates are not available via Windows Update.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting and ActiveX Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, the Log Sink Class ActiveX control will not be instantiated. With Active scripting disabled, the Log Sink Class ActiveX control cannot be scripted by a web site to create files automatically. Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Apply the Outlook Email Security Update Another way to effectively disable Active scripting in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements. Read and send email in plain text format Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Do not follow unsolicited links In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. <br> <a name=\"alt_browser\"> Use a different web browser\nThere have been a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, local file system (Local Machine Zone) trust, the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) document object model (in particular, proprietary DHTML features), the HTML Help system, MIME type determination, the graphical user interface (GUI), and ActiveX. These technologies are implemented in operating system libraries that are used by IE and many other programs to provide web browser functionality. IE is integrated into Windows to such an extent that vulnerabilities in IE or other ActiveX controls frequently provide an attacker significant access to the operating system. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser, especially when viewing untrusted HTML documents (e.g., web sites, HTML email messages). Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as proprietary DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control (WebOC), or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML)."
