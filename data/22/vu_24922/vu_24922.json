  "Impact": "Remote intruders may be able to retrieve cookies by sending an appropriately crafted email message. Further, by sending the email address in an HTML argument, an intruder may be able to associate cookies with email addresses. Note that it may be possible for an intruder to forge mail from a site that stores sensitive information in the cookies under the assumption that the cookies will only be transmitted via an SSL-secured session. Thus cookies that ordinarily contain sensitive information and that are normally sent in encrypted form can be transmitted in cleartext. If an intruder can sniff the connection between the legitimate site and the victim, he can recover the sensitive information.",
