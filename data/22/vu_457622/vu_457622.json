  "Impact": "An remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. The Samba daemon (smbd) typically runs with root privileges, in which case an attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. An attacker may also be able to mount a denial-of-service attack.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade Samba This issue has been corrected in Samba version 3.0.8. Please see the Samba download page for more details. Restrict Access to Samba As a general security best practice, restrict access to Samba services to hosts and networks that require those services. Consider blocking Samba traffic at network borders. Consult Samba Security Guidelines The Samba Team has a website listing ways to secure a Samba server.",
