  "Description": "We had users here who uncovered a serious csh\nproblem in Digital UNIX where any non-priv user could crash a DU 3.2d\nor DU 4.0 system with a certain sequence of commands. I reporte d this\nproblem to Digital, and they built a patch to take care of the\nproblem.  Since any common user could crash the system with this\nsequence of commands, it seems to me to be worth making\npublic. However, I don't know how to go about doing this. And I don't\nknow if Digital will announce it themselves in a timely fashion.",
