  "Description": "Cisco Network Building Mediator (NBM) products are designed to manage facility energy use. NBM products support automation protocols such as BACnet and Modbus; IT network protocols such as IP, SNMP, SSH, and HTTP/S; and application protocols like XML-RPC and SOAP. NBM products are affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including default administrative credentials, privilege escalation, plaintext transmission of credentials, and unauthenticated access to a file containing credentials. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities using several attack vectors over SSH, HTTP/S, and XML-RPC. Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20100526-mediator notes: \"These vulnerabilities affect the legacy Richards-Zeta Mediator 2500 product and Cisco Network Building Mediator NBM-2400 and NBM-4800 models. All Mediator Framework software releases prior to 3.1.1 are affected by all vulnerabilities listed in this security advisory.\" See also ICS-CERT Advisory ICSA-10-147-01.",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain complete control over the mediator. An authorized user could gain administrative privileges, and a remote attacker could cause a denial of service.",
