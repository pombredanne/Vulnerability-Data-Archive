Dependent Packages:  none Description: Michal Zalewski discovered [1] a confirmed [2] buffer overflow\n  vulnerability in all version of the Sendmail [0] MTA earlier than\n  8.12.9. The mail address parser performs insufficient bounds checking\n  in certain conditions due to a \"char\" to \"int\" data type conversion,\n  making it possible for an attacker to take control of the application. Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to gain \"root\"\n  access of any vulnerable Sendmail server. The Common Vulnerabilities\n  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0161 [3] to the\n  problem. Please check whether you are affected by running \"<prefix>/bin/rpm\n  -q sendmail\". If you have the \"sendmail\" package installed and its\n  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately\n  upgrade it (see Solution). [4] [5] Solution: Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release\n  [6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7] or a mirror location,\n  verify its integrity [8], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [4]\n  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [5]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following operations\n  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust\n  accordingly). $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org\n  ftp> bin\n  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD\n  ftp> get sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm\n  ftp> bye\n  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm\n  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm\n  $ su -\n  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.*.rpm References: [0] http://www.sendmail.org/\n  [1] http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-March/008973.html\n  [2] http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/316760/2003-03-26/2003-04-01/0\n  [3] http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0161\n  [4] http://www.openpkg.org/tutorial.html#regular-source\n  [5] http://www.openpkg.org/tutorial.html#regular-binary\n  [6] ftp://ftp.openpkg.org/release/1.2/UPD/sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm\n  [7] ftp://ftp.openpkg.org/release/1.2/UPD/\n  [8] http://www.openpkg.org/security.html#signature For security reasons, this advisory was digitally signed with the\nOpenPGP public key \"OpenPKG <openpkg@openpkg.org>\" (ID 63C4CB9F) of the\nOpenPKG project which you can retrieve from http://pgp.openpkg.org and\nhkp://pgp.openpkg.org.
