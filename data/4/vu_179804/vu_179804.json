  "Workarounds": "Block or Restrict XDMCP Traffic Block XDMCP traffic (177/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Keep in mind that blocking ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable service from the internal network. In most cases, it is trivial for an attacker to spoof the source of a UDP packet, so restricting xdmcp access to specific IP addresses may be ineffective. Consider network configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. Disable xdmcp in dtlogin Depending on service requirements, disable XDMCP support in dtlogin. On a SunOS 5.8 system: /usr/dt/config/Xconfig /etc/dt/config/Xconfig #  To disable listening for XDMCP requests from X-terminals. Dtlogin.requestPort:       0"
