  "Overview": "A core service of  Microsoft Windows 2000 domain controllers  fails to correctly handle certain invalid requests. After receiving a number of invalid requests, the domain controller may have to be rebooted to return it to correct operation. A disabled domain controller can interfere with the ordinary operation of all machines in the domain.",
