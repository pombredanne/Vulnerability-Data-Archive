  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating symbolic links with appropriate names, a local attacker may cause the creation or overwrite of other files writable by the user running Netscape Communicator. Since the files would be set to be world-writable, the attacker may be able to compromise the user's account.",
