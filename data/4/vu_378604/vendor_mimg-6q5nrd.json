  "VendorStatement": "We are fully aware of this issue, but have no plans to update our software at this time. In our opinion this vulnerability note does not affect wodSFTP's security or strength - it only explains that wodSFTP can be used by malicious software. Trying to remove 'safe for scripting' flag would affect wodSFTP's functionality and it wouldn't be usable in certain environments at all."
