  "Workarounds": "Restrict Access Verify the router's web interface is not Internet accessible. As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the router web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. Do Not Stay Logged Into the Router's Management Interface Always log out of the router's management interface when done using it."
