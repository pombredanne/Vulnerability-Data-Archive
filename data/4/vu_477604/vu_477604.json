  "Workarounds": "Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document and the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Putting the IVE server address in a zone that has ActiveX enabled, such as Trusted Sites, will retain IVE functionality."
