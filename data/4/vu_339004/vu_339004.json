  "Resolution": "Apply an update This issue is addressed in the 2.6 version of the CryptoStor Tape 700 Series firmware. According to NeoScale, this version of the firmware makes the following changes: a) changing the CryptoStor ActiveX component to not perform the actual authentication only to report on its success or failure. The CryptoStor ActiveX component version number was also changed. b) changes to the cgi-bin program within the CryptoStor Appliance to perform the actual authentication. The cgi-bin program was also modified to not work with the original version of the CryptoStor ActiveX component c) implementation of a Thawte certificate for the CryptoStor ActiveX component",
