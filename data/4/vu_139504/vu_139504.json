  "Workarounds": "Restrict access Block or restrict UDP(7P) packets destined for port 177/udp from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Disable XDMCP connections According to the Sun Security Alert, xdm(1M) can be configured to not listen for XDMCP connections by editing the \"/usr/openwin/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config\" file and adding the following line: DisplayManager.requestPort: 0 Note: Controlling access via the access control list in the \"Xaccess\" file is not effective at preventing this issue."
