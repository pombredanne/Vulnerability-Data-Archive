  "Description": "pset(1M) is a program used to display and modify information concerning\nthe use of processor sets in the current system.  The pset command is\nused on multi-processor systems to restrict the execution of different\nclasses of jobs.\n\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc. acknowledges the eject buffer overrun vulnerability\npublically reported by several individuals and in AUSCERT Advisory AA-97.20.\n\nCurrently, Silicon Graphics Inc. is investigating and no further information\nis available for public release at this time.\n\nAs further information becomes available, additional advisories will be\nissued via the normal SGI security information distribution methods\nincluding the wiretap mailing list.",

  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Due to insufficient bounds checking on arguments which are supplied\nby users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the\npset program while it is executing. By supplying a carefully designed\nargument to the pset program, intruders may be able to force pset to\nexecute arbitrary commands. As pset is setgid sys, this may allow\nintruders to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of group sys. This may then be leveraged to gain root privileges.",
