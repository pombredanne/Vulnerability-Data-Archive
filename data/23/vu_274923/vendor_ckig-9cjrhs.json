  "VendorStatement": "The Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm was one of three random number generators made available to developers as options in DSF, NanoCrypto, and related products. All DSF components, including NanoCrypto, default to using FIPS 186 pseudorandom number generation, NOT Dual_EC_DRBG. The flawed Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm is available as an option in our DSF SDKs, and your developers may have \u201cturned it on\u201d at build time, overriding the Mocana default selection of FIPS 186; or they may have explicitly called the ECDRBG engine. If neither of these two steps were taken, then the random number generation algorithm used is not the compromised Dual_EC_DRBG."
