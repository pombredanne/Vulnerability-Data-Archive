  "VendorStatement": "\"Due to recent statements (top of page #2) by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concerning the security of the Dual_EC_DRBG cryptographic algorithm, Juniper Networks would like to make the following statements: The following product families do not utilize Dual_EC_DRBG: Junos - Any product running Junos\nJunos Pulse Secure Access Service (SSL-VPN / IVE OS)\nJunos Pulse Access Control Service (UAC)\nJunos Pulse\nJunos Space\nJunosE\nCTP/CTPView The following product families do utilize Dual_EC_DRBG, but do not use the pre-defined points cited by NIST: ScreenOS*\n* ScreenOS does make use of the Dual_EC_DRBG standard, but is designed to not use Dual_EC_DRBG as its primary random number generator. ScreenOS uses it in a way that should not be vulnerable to the possible issue that has been brought to light. Instead of using the NIST recommended curve points it uses self-generated basis points and then takes the output as an input to FIPS/ANSI X.9.31 PRNG, which is the random number generator used in ScreenOS cryptographic operations.\""
