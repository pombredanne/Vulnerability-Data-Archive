  "VendorStatement": "\"On September 17, 2013 an Edward Snowden leak indicated that the NSA may have a skeleton key to decrypt messages using the Dual Elliptic Curve (EC) Deterministic Random Bit Generation (DRBG) algorithm in RSA\u2019s BSafe library. This was followed by NIST reopening SP800-90 due to some concerns the community has regarding the security of the DUAL_EC_DRBG algorithm. The RSA BSafe crypto libraries are widely used for C, C++, and Java based programs used by many vendors, including McAfee. The libraries are also certified as FIPS 140-2 thus providing an avenue to certifying products as directed by NIST. Impact: Currently, McAfee has three (3) products that use Dual EC DBRG, and thus, are vulnerable. Vulnerability Manager for Databases (DVM) / Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)\nNetwork Security Management (NSM) appliances\nMcAfee Firewall Enterprise Control Center (MFE CC)\nNOTE: MFE CC uses the CryptoJ BSAFE and Dual EC DRBG in FIPS mode only. Customers who do not run in FIPS mode never use Dual EC DRBG. The use of Dual EC DRBG was removed in 5.3.2 This issue is resolved in each of the vulnerable products per the release schedule in the Remediation section of this article.\""
