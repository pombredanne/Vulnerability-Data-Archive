  "VendorInformation": "Only the OpenSSL FIPS module implements DUAL_EC_DRBG but it is not enabled by default. The standard distributions of OpenSSL do not utilize DUAL_EC_DRBG.",

  "VendorReferences": "None",
  "VendorStatement": "\"The OpenSSL FIPS module is a cryptographic module which has been put through FIPS 140-2 testing. It is completely separate from OpenSSL itself. If certain versions of OpenSSL are linked against that module they become \"FIPS capable\" and redirect cryptographic operations to the OpenSSL FIPS module. If OpenSSL is not linked against the FIPS module the DUAL_EC_DRBG is not available at all. The DUAL_EC_DRBG is not used by default in any versions of OpenSSL. It is implemented in the current version of the OpenSSL FIPS module but the FIPS capable versions of OpenSSL will not use it by default. Specific calls need to be made to use the DUAL_EC_DRBG: i.e. it cannot be used \"by accident\". In other words unless the application makes very specific calls to enable the DUAL_EC_DRBG it will never be used.\""
