  "Workarounds": "The following workarounds were suggested by David Litchfield and have not been tested by CERT/CC. To disable SOAP, delete or comment-out the following lines in the file named \"$ORACLE_HOME/Apache/Jserv/etc/jserv.conf\": ApJServGroup group2 1 1\n$ORACLE_HOME/Apache/Jserv/etc/jservSoap.properties\nApJServMount /soap/servlet ajpv12://localhost:8200/soap\nApJServMount /dms2 ajpv12://localhost:8200/soap\nApJServGroupMount /soap/servlet balance://group2/soap Note that in the lines above, \"$ORACLE_HOME\" may be spelled out, and the port number may differ from 8200. To prevent SOAP services from being deployed or undeployed, add the following line to the file named \"$ORACLE_HOME/soap/werbapps/soap/WEB-INF/config/soapConfig.xml\": <osc:option name=\"autoDeploy\" value=\"false\" />"
