  "VendorStatement": "This vulnerability was addressed in the basic design of our Addon keypad since \nits inception. The SH Designs program cannot be used to modify the firmware in \nour keypad without specialized knowledge of specific procedures necessary to \ninitiate a firmware replacement. We have further strengthened the procedure as of firmware version 5.5.05 to \ninclude the necessity to also enter the administrator password to initiate a \nfirmware replacement. To identify which type of protection your keypad has, verify the program \nversion in the keypad by looking at the printed header at power-up. To be clear, the SH Designs program that has the vulnerability would normally \nonly be used by trained service personnel on a very infrequent basis. Field \nupdates to the firmware in the keypad are not often done. Also, specific \nknowledge of the keypad operation is necessary to use the SH Designs program to \nperform a firmware update. Furthermore, the knowledge and time investment \nnecessary to create and install a program that might be able to perform a \nmalicious action with an embedded processor like the one used in our keypad \ncreates a very unlikely scenario that it would ever be attempted. Our product \ndoes not even use a standard operating system. The keypad is also normally used \nin a secure location that would have UDP access restricted at the router to the \nsubnet level."
