  "Description": "           A vulnerability exists in BSDI rlogind that has the\n               potential to allow an attacker to gain remote root\n               access on any server running BSDI 2.1 or earlier with\n               rlogind enabled.\n \n               This vulnerability occurs as a result of inverse\n               resolution of IP addresses to hostnames.  An attacker \n               in control of a DNS server can configure the records for \n               a specific IP address to resolve with a name larger than\n               rlogind can handle.\n \n               Due to insufficient bounds checking, a buffer\n               overflow can result when rlogind attempts to copy the\n               connecting hostname into a buffer with a predefined size.\n \n               While overwriting the buffer, the attacker can manipulate\n               the stack and execute their own commands, possibly gaining\n               root access on the server.\n \n               For more information on this type of attack, point your\n               web browsers to: http://www.repsec.com/bofs.html.\n \n \n   \n \n   \n ",

To disable rlogind: 1. su to the root account\n               2. kill -9 `ps -aux | grep rlogind | awk '{print $2}'`\n               3. edit /etc/inetd.conf with your favorite editor\n               4. place a # in front of any lines beginning with \"login\""
