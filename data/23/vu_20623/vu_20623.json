  "Description": "When users fail to logout of sessions and leave\nprocesses (shells) running on a pseudo-tty, new login/X sessions\ncan be assigned that tty at which point the new user finds\nherself talking to an existing shell owned by another uid.\n\nIf root exits openwindows without closing all the shell and cmd tool\nwindows, then the pty's assigned to those windows can be used by a non\nroot user.  If a user logs in across a net work and is assigned one of\nthe pty's he will become root. The problem will not occur if all the\nwindows are closed before root logs off.",
