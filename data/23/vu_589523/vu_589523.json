  "ID": "VU#589523",
  "IDNumber": "589523",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Without knowledge of the shared secret, an attacker can cause a denial of service against the server, or the client via the server response. With knowledge of the shared secret, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. In certain implementations, specific knowledge of the shared secret is not required to execute arbitrary code if the last 1 or 2 bytes of the shared secret are with in a certain range.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Implementing a firewall to filter packets from outside of your network perimeter from being sent to the RADIUS server may help reduce the risk of attack. Note that this is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited by users who are within your network perimeter."
