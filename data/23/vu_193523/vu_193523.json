  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could gain access to an Oracle PL/SQL application. Depending on the capabilities of the application, the attacker could read, modify, or delete data.",
  "Keywords": [
    "Oracle 9iAS",

  "Overview": "A vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). By specifying the Database Access Descriptor (DAD) used to access a PL/SQL application, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application.",

  "Resolution": "Block or Restrict Access\nUnauthenticated PUBLIC access to PL/SQL applications and procedures can be restricted using the exclusion_list parameter in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. This solution is described in Oracle Security Alert #28. For more information, read the section titled Protecting the PL/SQL Procedures Granted to PUBLIC in the Oracle iAS documentation under Using the PL/SQL Gateway.",
