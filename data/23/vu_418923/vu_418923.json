  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nThe C2 WebResource web interface is vulnerable to XSS on the following URL and parameter: https://c2webresource/fileview.asp?File=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>",
  "ID": "VU#418923",
  "IDNumber": "418923",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the C2 WebResource web interface can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which may be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.",

  "VRDA_D1_DirectReport": "1",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the C2 WebResource web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
