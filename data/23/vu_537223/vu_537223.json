  "Description": "Tavis Ormandy's advisory states: \"$ORIGIN is an ELF substitution sequence representing the location of the executable being loaded in the filesystem hierarchy. The intention is to allow executables to specify a search path for libraries that is relative to their location, to simplify packaging without spamming the standard search paths with single-use libraries.\" \"$ORIGIN is only expanded if it is alone and first in the path. This makes little sense, and does not appear to be useful even if there were no security impact. This was most likely the result of an attempt to re-use the existing DT_NEEDED resolution infrastructure for LD_AUDIT support, accidentally introducing this error. Perhaps surprisingly, this error is exploitable.\" Versions 2.12.1 on Fedora Core 13 and 2.5 on RHEL5 and CENTOS5 are known to be affected. Other versions and Linux distributions are probably affected but have not been confirmed at this time. Full details are available in Tavis Ormandy's advisory.",
