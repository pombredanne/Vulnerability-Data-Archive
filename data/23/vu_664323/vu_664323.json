  "Resolution": "Replace your MSP servlet with a new one, available from http://support.wolfram.com/webmathematica/security/fileaccess.html. Please note that If you run webMathematica from Apache JServ, then you will need to update your images.class servlet as well. Wolfram Research is currently testing and validating a fixed version of the images.class servlet.",
