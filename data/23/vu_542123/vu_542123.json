  "Description": "According to ISC: ISC has been notified by Haixin Duan (a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing China, who is currently visiting the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley) about a DNS resolver vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a miscreant to keep a domain name in the cache even after it has been deleted from registration. ISC is evaluating the risk of this vulnerability, but the published paper shows how this was done live across the Internet. It lists several DNS implementations and open resolver deployments as vulnerable. The exploit was presented at the NDSS conference: \"Ghost Domain Names: Revoked Yet Still Resolvable.\"",
