  "Workarounds": "Block packets with illogical source addresses Blocking traffic that originates from unlikely or illogical source addresses (such as addresses which are not on-link or logically part of a network assigned to an interface, such as the antispoof keyword in pf) will protect against this vulnerability. This workaround may cause unintended side-effects such as breaking some non-typical configurations. Vendors may also implement this workaround as a fix. Use application layer encryption Applications that use secure authentication and encryption such as https, ssh, and ipsec can mitigate this vulnerability by preventing an attacker from intercepting or parsing any data that received. Note that an attacker will probably still be able to blackhole IP addresses resulting in a local denial of service regardless of the authentication or encryption methods used. As noted in RFC 3971, it is non-trivial to use ipsec to protect the integrity of NDP messages. Design and deploy segmented networks In a single IPv6 prefix there are certain trust asumptions and if the same IP range is shared all clients will be considered on-link. Segmenting networks will reduce the likelihood of this and similar vulnerabilities from being exploited. Networks can be segmented by assigning unique prefixes to individual router interfaces or by using VLANs."
