  "ID": "VU#886963",
  "IDNumber": "886963",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.",
  "Keywords": [
    "talkd",
    "format string",
    "print_mesg()",

  ],
  "Overview": "Multiple UNIX/Linux vendors ship their operating systems with a service called talkd. talkd is the daemon that notifies a user that someone else wishes to initiate a talk conversation. A vulnerability exists in this daemon that may permit a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the system.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.",

  "Workarounds": "Until you can install a vendor patch, disable any talkd programs found in /etc/inetd.conf by commenting out those lines and restarting inetd. Example commands executed as root: # grep -i talk /etc/inetd.conf talk     dgram     udp     wait     root     /usr/etc/in.talkd     in.talkd Comment out *all* references to talkd, otalkd or ntalkd. (Comments in # /etc/inetd.conf begin with \"#\".) After editing /etc/inetd.conf, restart inetd. On many Unix systems, this is done by sending the inetd process a HUP signal. For SYSV: # ps -ef | grep inetd | grep -v grep\n                 # kill -HUP {inetd PID} For BSD: # ps -aux | grep inetd | grep -v grep\n                 # kill -HUP {inetd PID}"
