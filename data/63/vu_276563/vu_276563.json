  "Description": "Autonomy KeyView SDK is a commercial software development kit (SDK) that includes file filtering libraries. A vulnerability exists in the way the SDK libraries process specially crafted WordPerfect documents. According to iDefense: This vulnerability exists within the \"wp6sr.dll,\" which implements the processing of WordPerfect documents. When processing certain records, data is copied from the file into a fixed-size stack buffer without ensuring that enough space is available. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite control flow structures stored on the stack. Note that this issue affects products that use Autonomy KeyView SDK. These include IBM Lotus Notes and Symantec products.",
