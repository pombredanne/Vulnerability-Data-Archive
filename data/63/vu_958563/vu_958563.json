  "Workarounds": "Use CTR Mode SSH can be done using Counter (CTR) mode encryption. This mode generates the keystream by encrypting successive values of a \"counter\" function. For more information see the Block Cipher Modes article on wikipedia. In order to mitigate this vulnerabilty SSH can be setup to use CTR mode rather CBC mode. According to CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH: The most straightforward solution is to use CTR mode instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack. An RFC already exists to standardise counter mode for use in SSH (RFC 4344) ..."
