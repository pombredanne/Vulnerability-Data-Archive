  "Vendor": "VanDyke Software",
  "VendorInformation": "The advisory recommends using the AES cipher in CTR mode rather than CBC mode. VShell for some platforms, SecureCRT, SecureFX, and the VanDyke ClientPack for some platforms now prefer the AES cipher in CTR mode by default. Please see the following web page for more information. http://www.vandyke.com/support/advisory/2008/12/cpni-957037.html",
