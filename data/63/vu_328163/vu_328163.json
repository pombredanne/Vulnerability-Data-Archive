  "Resolution": "Apply the patches found in MS02-008. http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/q317244/download.asp Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security vulnerability in Microsoft XML 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft XML 4.0 Service Pack 1. To download MSXML 4.0 Service Pack 1, visit the following Microsoft Web site: http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/766/msdncompositedoc.xml MSXML can also be installed separately. MSXML is installed as a DLL in the System32 subfolder of the Windows operating system folder. On most systems, this will likely be C:\\Windows or C:\\winnt. If you have any or all of the following files in the System32 folder, you need the patch: Msxml2.dll \nMsxml3.dll \nMsxml4.dll If you have only Msxml.dll, you do not need the patch because this is an earlier, unaffected version.",
