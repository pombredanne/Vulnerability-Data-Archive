  "Description": "Terminals that react to data they are printing on\nthe screen are at some level under the control of an attacker.\nIn particular, \"answerback\" escape sequences that send data back\nto the system as if the terminal user had typed them can be\nexploited.  Any means of displaying data on someone else's\nterminal will do and common choices have been talk, write, ntalk,\nand wall.  But biff, any form of e-mail, or even file left\nlying around to be edited can be used as well.  The only\nway to block all of these attacks efficiently is to\naddress the issue in the terminal emulators.\n\nSome vendors have addressed the problem in the individual programs\nlisted above.  This is not bad, and at least has the advantage\nof blocking some of the most common attacks.",
