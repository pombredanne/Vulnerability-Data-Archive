  "Workarounds": "The attacks described in this document are difficult to block completely, but there are several improvements that developers can make to reduce their impacts. Several of these techniques are described below: Use firewall features that detect and block flood traffic Many firewalls provide features that can detect and block UDP and TCP SYN floods. The CERT/CC recommends that site administrators make use of these features whenever possible. Use dynamically resizeable state tables State tables that use dynamically allocated storage can expand to accommodate large numbers of states. This will increase the difficulty of exploiting this vulnerability, but it is important to note that the size of a dynamic state table will still be bounded by a firewall's available memory. Use separate timeout values for initial sessions Maintaining separate session timers for initial and established sessions allows state table entries generated by attack traffic to be rapidly removed while still permitting legitimate entries to remain in the state table. Since most attacks rely upon forged IP source addresses from which no reply is expected, attack traffic is unlikely to create state table entries that appear to be established sessions. Use dynamically adjustable session timers (Aggressive Aging) As the session time out value decreases, the attacker must increase the traffic rate to ensure that new entries are created faster than the firewall is permitted to remove them. By using dynamic session timers that decrease in response to state table congestion, the firewall can increase its rate of session expiration, making this vulnerability more difficult to exploit. Allow connection tracking to be disabled The ability to disable connection tracking for certain protocols would provide administrators with increased flexibility in defending against the attacks described above."
