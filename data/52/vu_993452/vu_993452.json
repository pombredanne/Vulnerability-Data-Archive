  "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to cause sendmail to free() arbitrary chunks of memory. This could crash affected sendmail daemons, causing a denial of service. If an area of memory being freed is under the control of the intruder, remote execution of code with the privileges of the running daemon may be possible.",

  "Overview": "There is an uninitialized data structure in sendmail 8.12.(x < 9) servers configured to use DNS maps. An attacker able to send crafted DNS responses to affected sendmail servers may be able crash the sendmail daemon, or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
