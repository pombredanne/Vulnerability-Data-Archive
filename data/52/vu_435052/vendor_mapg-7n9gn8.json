  "Revision": 4,
  "Status": "Vulnerable",
  "Vendor": "Ziproxy",
  "VendorInformation": "Ziproxy 2.7.0 and newer versions include provisions that mitigate this vulnerability. Details are included in the software documentation",
  "VendorRecordID": "MAPG-7N9GN8",
  "VendorReferences": "",
  "VendorStatement": "For servers running Ziproxy in transparent proxy mode, it is strongly recommended to set the following options as below: ConventionalProxy = false\nAllowMethodCONNECT = false When running as a conventional proxy (non-transparent), it is strongly\nrecommended to read the documentation on the following option: AllowMethodCONNECT Running Ziproxy in both transparent and conventional modes simultaneously is\ndiscouraged for security reasons. In transparent mode, the latest version of Ziproxy (2.6.0) trusts the host and\nport provided in the HTTP headers. This may be exploited using a hand-crafted\nHTTP request so to access arbitrary websites. In order to address this specific vulnerability, firewall rules may be used and/or an additional HTTP proxy with more security mechanisms may be\ninstalled between the clients and Ziproxy. Since Ziproxy is not a caching proxy, cache poisoning issues do not apply."
