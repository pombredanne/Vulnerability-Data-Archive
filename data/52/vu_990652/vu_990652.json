  "Description": "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CVE-2012-6273\nDuring the SHU request (search user) from the bigant messaging client, a sql query is built from a template and sent via a http like header. Proper sanitization is not performed. It has been reported this can be demonstrated by opening up the BigAnt Messenger Client, logging into a server, and searching for an 'Account/Full Name' of blah' OR hs_User.Col_Pword LIKE '[a-z] CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges - CVE-2012-6274\nArbitrary unauthenticated file upload in BigAnt IM Server. It has been reported that authentication for file uploads is not enforced. Uploaded files were reported to be saved to C:\\Program Files\\BigAntSoft\\AntServer\\DocData\\Public. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2012-6275\nBuffer overflow in AntDS.exe component of BigAnt Message server when handling the filename header in SCH requests and userid component of DUPF requests.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi, unauthenticated file uploads, or denial of service attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
