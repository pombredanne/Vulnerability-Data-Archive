  "Description": "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nThe AirDroid web interface fails to sanitize malicious code within a text message on the target phone causing the script to be executed on the host computer.",
  "ID": "VU#557252",
  "IDNumber": "557252",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker with access to the phone being controlled by AirDroid can send a text message with malicious code. When this message is viewed on the AirDroid web interface an attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which may be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service on the host computer.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Restrict access As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS, CSRF, or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the AirDroid web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location."
