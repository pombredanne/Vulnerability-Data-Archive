  "IDNumber": "732952",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Using specially crafted client certificate messages, a remote attacker can attempt to exploit underlying vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS ASN.1 parsing implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities (VU#935264, VU#255484, VU#380864, and VU#686224) are denial of service and possible execution of arbitrary code.",

  "Resolution": "Upgrade or Patch\nUpgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c  or 0.9.6k. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an advisory from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries.",
