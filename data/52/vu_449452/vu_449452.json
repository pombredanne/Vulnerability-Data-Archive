  "Resolution": "Apply an update manually CVE-2014-6255 and CVE-2014-9246 (Sessions Do Not Expire) are resolved in the latest Zenoss Core 4.2.5 SP. Manually download the update as described below (\"Disable automatic update check\"), and apply the update as soon as possible. Zenoss plans for most of the rest of the issues to be addressed in a future maintenance release of Zenoss Core 5. For more information, please see this spreadsheet; specifically the \"Vendor Status\" column which provides the vendor's response for the issue, and the \"Zenoss Bug ID\" column which provides Zenoss's internal tracking number for the issue.",

  "Workarounds": "Use SSL/HTTPS CVE-2014-9250 can be mitigated by enabling SSL/HTTPS to better protect cookie-based authentication data. Please see Zenoss's recommendation in this spreadsheet. Disable automatic update check CVE-2014-6261 can be mitigated by unchecking \"Check For Updates\" in the Zenoss Versions page in the web interface. Note that you can also manually check for updates in the web interface, which triggers the same actions, and is therefore also vulnerable. Instead, users should check the Zenoss website for new versions, rather than using the in-app check. To avoid CSRF exploitation, users should also use a separate browser (or profile) for Zenoss, that is not shared with any other browsing."
