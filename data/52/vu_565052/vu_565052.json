  "ID": "VU#565052",
  "IDNumber": "565052",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The password used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session.",
  "Keywords": [
    "SSH",
    "RC4",
    "passwords",
    "crack"
  ],
  "Overview": "Passwords sent using SSH with RC4 encryption can be easily cracked by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session. This problem occurs for three reasons: SSH sessions can be replayed, the RC4 encryption algorithm has some specific weaknesses, and the SSH daemon provides too much information during the authentication phase of the protocol.",
  "References": [

  ],
  "Resolution": "Do not use RC4 encryption Because this vulnerability relies on a feature of RC4 encryption, the attack can be prevented by using a different encryption algorithm.",
