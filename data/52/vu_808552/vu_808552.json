  ],
  "Overview": "A variety of ftp servers incorrectly manage buffers in a way that can lead to remote intruders executing arbitrary code on the FTP server. The incorrect management of buffers centers around the return from the glob() function, and may be confused with a related denial-of-service problem. These problems were discovered by the COVERT Labs at PGP Security.",
