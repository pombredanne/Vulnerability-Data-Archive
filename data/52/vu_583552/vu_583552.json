  "Workarounds": "Disable the Affected Wireless Adapter\nUntil updates can be applied, turning off the wireless adapter can mitigate this vulnerability. To turn off the wireless card, follow the instructions found in Apple's knowledgebase: Turning AirPort off\nTurn your AirPort Card off when you're in situations where radio communication may be prohibited, such as in an airplane or at a hospital. 1. Open the Internet Connect application and click AirPort in the toolbar. 2. Click Turn AirPort Off. If you have disabled the AirPort port in Network preferences, then your AirPort Card is already turned off. To disable the AirPort port, choose Network Port Configurations from the Show pop-up menu and deselect the AirPort checkbox."
