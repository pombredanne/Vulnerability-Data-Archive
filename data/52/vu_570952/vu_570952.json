  "ID": "VU#570952",
  "IDNumber": "570952",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By creating a symbolic link with appropriate name and pointed to any writable file on the system, a local attacker can corrupt that file when diskcheck detects a file system approaching capacity.",

  ],
  "Overview": "Diskcheck.pl is a PERL script, part of Red Hat's powertools suite, that alerts a system administrator if any file system approaches capacity. In creating email alerts, diskcheck.pl creates insecure temporary files in a world-writable directory, which may permit an attacker to corrupt any writable file on the system.",
